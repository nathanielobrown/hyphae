# The UI development loop

Edit a viewer component or stylesheet and see it in the browser without touching the browser. Two things make that a loop: `mise run gallery`, which serves every scenario the viewer tier pins, and `hp view --dev`, which reloads the open page when you save. What each page shows is in [the viewer guide](viewer.md); the conventions a component has to hold to are in `.claude/rules/viewer-ui.md`. Those same pages are what the browser tier drives, which is the last section here.

## Open the scenario you are about to change

```bash
mise run gallery
```

The gallery builds a store from the redacted fixtures, serves it in dev mode, and prints its index — `/gallery` on port 8478, one past the viewer's own default, so a gallery and a viewer over your own store can be open side by side. The index lists every entry of `tests/view/scenarios.py:SCENARIOS` under a heading for its kind of page: what each one shows, and the route it stands for beside it. Click the one you are working on.

Its clock is the corpus's, not the wall's: the gallery reads the present off the store it built — the newest session end in it — so how long ago a session ran says the same thing today and next month, and the trailing windows a listing page counts back hold sessions rather than nothing. Nothing turns that off, and the viewer over your own store keeps its real clock (`tests/gallery/serve.py`).

`mise run gallery --port 9001` moves it, which is how a second branch's gallery opens beside the first. That flag is the only argument it takes, and neither a path nor an environment variable can reach it: session data is private, and what keeps this tool from serving the canonical store is that the process can only build its own corpus (`tests/gallery/serve.py`). That build costs well under a second, so it happens on every launch and nothing is cached.

## Save the file and watch the page

A page is Python, so a save is one of two things. Save a stylesheet and the page swaps its sheets in place, keeping the scroll and everything else a reload would cost — that is the reload stream, and it costs about 0.2 s. Save a component and uvicorn restarts the server under you; the stream drops with the old worker and the open page reloads on the reconnect, a few seconds later, onto what the new one serves. Both the gallery and `hp view --dev` run that way. `.claude/rules/viewer-ui.md` records what a real Chromium did with each.

A reload costs a reader nothing here because every state but NavTree width rides the URL: the page comes back at the node, the view and the knobs it was on. That is why the loop needs no hot module replacement and no DOM morphing.

A restart rebuilds what the process built at startup, which for the gallery means its store — under a second, from the redacted fixtures, into a directory named after the gallery you started.

Ruff formats a component like any other Python, so there is no second formatter and no layout to keep. One thing to know before you edit one: **the whitespace on the page is only what you wrote.** htpy writes nothing between two elements, so a space a reader has to see is an explicit `" "` child — and nothing catches one that is deleted (`.claude/rules/viewer-ui.md`).

## Run the same loop over your own store

```bash
uv run hp view --dev
```

`--dev` mounts the reload stream, puts its client on every page, and runs the server under uvicorn's reloader. It changes nothing else: a shipped page is a dev page minus one script tag. The watcher's dependency lives in the dev group, so an installed viewer never carries it and `--dev` in a checkout without it fails at startup rather than serving a loop that never fires. Run `mise run sync` if it does.

## Add a route and the gallery gains the page

`SCENARIOS` has three readers: the viewer tier, which sweeps every URL in it and checks the routes those entries are served by against the routes the app declares; the gallery, which lists it; and `tools/gen_e2e_routes.py`, which writes it out for the browser tier. A route added with no entry fails `tests/view/test_bounds.py`, and the entry that clears it is the page you can then open in the gallery. No reader keeps a list of its own to drift.

## Check the pages in a real browser

```bash
mise run e2e
```

Playwright drives a real Chromium over a gallery of its own on port 8479, started and stopped by the run, so a gallery or a viewer you already have open is left alone. The specs are TypeScript under `tests/e2e`, and `e2e` depends on `e2e-deps`, which installs the npm packages and the browser. It stays out of `mise run check` for the reason `mutate` does: it needs a browser.

The tier owns only what a `TestClient` structurally cannot see — whether the console stayed empty under the viewer's `default-src 'self'`, and where an htmx swap actually landed. The Python tier goes on sweeping every scenario for 200 under budget, so nothing is proved twice. `tools/gen_e2e_routes.py` writes the scenario list out as `tests/e2e/routes.json` for a spec to read; run `uv run python -m tools.gen_e2e_routes` after adding a scenario, or the leaf that compares the checked-in file against `SCENARIOS` reds.

A sweep also archives each full page — its DOM and every resource it fetched. `mise run e2e-chromatic` sends those archives to Chromatic, which renders each one in its own browser and diffs it against the project's baseline, so a font stack that differs between macOS and Linux never decides a diff. It wants `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` in `.env` or the environment and refuses before reaching the network without one (`tests/e2e/chromatic-upload.sh`). `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs the sweep and the upload on a pull request and on `main`; it is the only workflow in the repo holding a secret, and a fork's pull request runs everything but the upload rather than failing on a token it was never given. On a pull request it snapshots the branch's own tip rather than GitHub's merge preview, so a baseline you accept stays accepted when the base moves under it.

What goes up is the redacted fixture corpus rendered as pages, and nothing else can be: the gallery serves only the store it builds. That is what makes sending these pages to a third party acceptable at all.
