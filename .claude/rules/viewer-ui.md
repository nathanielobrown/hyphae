# Viewer UI

The viewer is server-rendered [htpy](https://htpy.dev) — one typed Python function per thing a page shows — with three scripts on a shipped page: vendored htmx, `src/hyphae/view/static/nav-tree-width.js` for the one thing a reader sets that no URL carries, and `src/hyphae/view/static/nav-tree.js` for the two things a row's place on the screen decides. A fourth, `src/hyphae/view/static/dev-reload.js`, rides `hp view --dev` alone (below). These are the conventions the viewer's own files hold to; what each page shows is in `docs/viewer.md`, the three rules every markup module holds to are in `src/hyphae/view/components/__init__.py`, and how to edit a component with the page open in front of you is in `docs/ui-development.md`. The package is organized by page and then by kind: a page's routes, markup and presenters sit in its own package under `src/hyphae/view/pages/`, over a shared layer no page reaches up into, and `tests/view/test_layout.py` holds that tree.

# One body, two mounts

A node's body is one function, `src/hyphae/view/pages/node/markup/body.py`'s `body`, mounted twice:

- Its **full view**, `src/hyphae/view/pages/node/markup/page.py`, wraps the body with the NavTree, the crumbs above it, its enrichment, its previewed values, its children log, and prev/next
- Its **expansion**, the same module's `expansion`, is the body alone — opened in a log row while the reader stays on the parent

Render a node's facts in that function and nowhere else. A pane and a NavTree row that disagree tell a reader two stories about one node.

An expansion stops one level down. An api call's lists the tools it called, through the same log function the page renders; every other kind stands a count and a link to its own page. No row inside an expansion opens another: an accordion of accordions is a page, and the node already has one.

Every node reachable in the pane has a URL that renders the whole page cold. Nothing may render only as a fragment.

# A node's title comes off the node

Print `Node.nav_tree_title`, `tab_title`, `crumb_title`, `log_title` or `pane_title`, whichever fits the surface. Never join words in a component and never print a row's own column where a node is being named: the five are one title at the width of the surface reading it, `tab_title` the text under a row's for the one surface with nowhere to put markup (`src/hyphae/view/nodes.py`), and a surface composing its own would be a second answer to what the node is called. What each kind is titled is in `docs/viewer-titles.md`.

# Naming and formatting live in Python; SQL ships fields

A query hands the page the fields a name is read off, and Python composes what the reader sees. `tool_names.name_tool` is the only place a tool call is named, `src/hyphae/view/nodes.py` the only place a node is, `src/hyphae/view/pages/node/numbers.py` the only place a dollar is split, and `src/hyphae/view/text/cuts.py` the only place a value is cut to the width its surface prints it at — so a fact printed on two surfaces was derived once.

A `view_*.sql` that builds a string is a second naming system, and the two drift apart in the direction nobody is looking: SQL cannot dispatch on a tool's name without a `CASE` arm per tool, so the tool nobody wrote an arm for goes unnamed rather than falling back. What SQL owns instead is the reading a page cannot afford: a fat column is cut to the width its caller asked for before it leaves the store (`src/hyphae/analyze/macros.py`).

# Tooltips are native `title` attributes

`title="…"` on the element, and nothing else — no first-party script, and `app.CSP` allows no inline `style`. It costs no bytes on a page that doesn't hover and no code at all.

A `title` is worth its bytes where the mark on screen is smaller than what it means: the enrichment glyph, and the `*` a cost carries when our price table priced none of some calls under it. Text a reader can already read doesn't get one.

# The glyph is bare in the NavTree, spelled out in the pane

`✨` marks a title a model helped write and leads the whole of it, halves the session wrote included (`docs/viewer.md`). Write it through `parts.glyph`, which reads `GLYPH` and `GLYPH_CLASS` from `src/hyphae/view/enrichment.py`; don't type the character into a component.

Where a title repeats — a NavTree row, a crumb, a log row, a walk control — the glyph goes bare. The pane carries the one that says what the mark means: `parts.summary` hangs `Described.provenance` off it as a `title`, naming the model, when it ran, the prompt and taxonomy versions, and whether the row is stale. A `title` on every repeat would be the same sentence 400 times in one page's markup.

Every mark saying what a thing *is* — the kind of node a surface names, and the kind a children log's column is about — goes through `parts.mark(character)`, whose character comes from `nodes.GLYPHS` or a `Column` — the one place those characters are written, so a mark cannot mean one thing in a table and another in the NavTree. It is `aria-hidden` and carries no `title`: the word it stands for is already in the markup beside it (`docs/viewer-titles.md`). The `<title>` element is the one place a mark goes in bare, because it is text and has no markup to hide it in.

A tool's own glyph is not one of these marks and does not go through `parts.mark`. It stands in for the tool's name inside the title's words (`src/hyphae/view/text/tool_names.py`), so it rides as text wherever the title does — including a children log, which heads the lead in a column of its own and would drop a mark written there.

# A NavTree row is priced, not budgeted

`bounds.NAV_TREE_ROW_BYTES` is measured through the app, pinned with no slack, and spent 3,217 times on the worst page. An attribute added to `src/hyphae/view/pages/node/markup/nav_tree.py`'s row is that many bytes of page, so re-measure with `tests/view/test_bounds__node.py` rather than guessing — the pin fails first, which is the point.

Link where you fetch: a row's `href` and its `hx-get` are the same URL, and both carry the page's knob suffix, so a click, a paste, and a bookmark serve the same bytes. The mount an expansion opens through carries it too, so the fragment's own links come back under the preset the reader was in.

# A pane swap says where it lands

A link that moves the reader without leaving the page carries six attributes, and all six have to be in effect on it: `hx-get` the node's URL, `hx-select="#reading-pane"`, `hx-target="#reading-pane"`, `hx-swap="outerHTML"`, `hx-select-oob="#nav-tree-rows"`, and `hx-push-url="true"`. The two that are easy to leave off are the two with defaults that look harmless: htmx aims at the clicked element, so a link without `hx-target` swaps the whole pane inside the `<a>` and leaves the pane showing the node the reader came from — the URL changes and the page does not. `hx-select` hands back the `#reading-pane` element itself rather than its contents, which is why the swap is `outerHTML` and not the default.

htmx reads all but `hx-get` off the closest ancestor carrying one, so the NavTree writes the five shared ones on `#nav-tree-rows` and a row's link carries only the URL. A children log writes them out per row instead: the body toggle beside each link is an `hx-get` that must not swap the pane, so a hoisted attribute would have to be undone on it — a line per row either way. `test_every_link_that_swaps_the_pane_lands_the_pane_in_the_pane` reads both mounts the way htmx resolves them, inheritance and all.

A fetch that is not a pane swap rides an element of its own beside the link. The popover a NavTree row fetches overrides every attribute `#nav-tree-rows` writes, and htmx walks up from whatever fetched: written on the `<li>`, those overrides would reach the link inside it and the click would stop swapping the pane. `hx-disinherit` is not the way out, because it stops the walk rather than skipping a level of it. So the trigger is a span of its own next to the link, and `hx-trigger`'s `from:closest li` keeps the row as the thing a reader points at (`src/hyphae/view/pages/node/markup/nav_tree.py`).

A served-HTML test reads the attributes; only a browser reads what they do. `tests/e2e/specs/htmx.spec.ts` clicks a row and reads where the pane landed, and points and tabs at a row for its popover. Witnessed by hand in a real Chromium on 2026-08-26, against `mise run gallery --port 9061` — never 8477, which is a live viewer — in both colour schemes:

- Pointing at a row fetched its popover after the delay and drew it on screen at the reading pane's left edge. Pointing at the same row again fetched nothing, so `once` holds
- The pointer moving into the popover left it open: `:hover` follows the DOM and not the layout, so it stays true inside a `position: fixed` descendant of the row
- Clicking inside the popover held it open after the pointer left, and did not navigate. `tabindex="-1"` makes the click focus it and `li.node:focus-within` keeps it up while a reader drags across a number, which is the affordance a pin would have added a second state for
- `Tab` onto a row's link fetched the popover the same way, so the keyboard reaches what the pointer reaches
- The row's link still swapped the pane, and the console stayed empty

# A colour on a bar is judged on the gallery

The context bar paints three bands and nothing under them, and a row's kind repaints a band (`src/hyphae/view/static/nav-tree.css`; the palette is in `tokens.css`). None of it is text, so no contrast ratio settles it. What a test holds is that the edges nest, that a thread, a compaction and a maxed row each leave the ramp where they should, and that every colour the bar spends is defined in both schemes. Which navy, which green, and whether the gray stays under the blue are eyeballed.

Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-09-01 against `mise run gallery --port 8494` — never 8477, which is a live viewer — in both colour schemes at 1400×900:

- A turn ran dark to bright along the row: navy for the context the session opened on, then the bright tip for what the turn added. The medium band between them stayed covered on every turn in the fixture corpus that carries a base, each one's prior edge landing on that base's own step. Two rows drew it: a call, whose base edge is zero, and one turn on a session the fixtures record no `main` call for, which leaves its base NULL and the row without a base class
- A session and a run drew one muted gray over the whole bar, quiet enough that reading down the column follows the blue and the threads are ground under it
- A compaction drew a short medium head and a long green band: the window it kept, then the window it gave back
- The run whose own thread compacted drew the full width in that same gray, and the red compaction badge beside it was the only alarm on the row
- Nothing was painted past the fill edge, so a bar ends where the window did and a row that draws no bar shows bare paper
- The console stayed empty

No turn in the fixture corpus drew all three bands apart until `spine/` kept one more call, so until then the ramp had never been looked at whole (`tests/fixtures/spine/README.md`; the leaf that holds it is `tests/view/pages/node/test_nav_tree__bars.py`). Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-09-02 against `mise run gallery --port 8495` — never 8477, which is a live viewer — in both colour schemes at 1400×900, beside `plans/context-bar-colors/prototypes-2.html#none-darker`, whose palette `tokens.css` carries byte for byte:

- The turn the gallery pins as "Turn, drawing all three context bands" drew `f10 p7 b3` over three visible steps: navy, then medium, then the bright tip. The medium reads as the same blue further along and not as a third hue, which is what the ramp was chosen for
- The turn above it drew `f7 p3 b3` — navy straight into bright, its prior edge landing on its base's step. That is the two-band shape the whole corpus used to draw, and against the row below it the difference needs no legend
- Dark reads the same on a shorter throw: the navy sits nearer the paper and the tip carries the row
- The console stayed empty

The compaction badge a run's row carries is judged beside the cost badge it stands next to. Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-08-28 against `mise run gallery --port 8492` — never 8477, which is a live viewer — at 1400×900: it drew the alarm at full strength with paper on it in light and ink on salmon in dark, against cost badges that are washes, so the count does not read as one more number in the row's money.

# A control beside the NavTree lives inside the swapped element

A NavTree row swaps `#nav-tree-rows` out of band and takes `#reading-pane` out of the response, so those two elements are the whole of what a click refreshes. Anything that names the selected node — the preset control does, three links to the node under each preset — has to render inside one of them or it goes stale the moment a reader clicks a row, pointing back at the node they left.

Put it inside `#nav-tree-rows` rather than adding a second out-of-band target: a target costs bytes on every NavTree row, and the row is the one thing on the page multiplied 3,217 times.

# The document does not scroll

The frame is a column exactly the viewport's height: the masthead takes what it needs, and what sits under it takes the rest and scrolls inside itself. Every page but the node browser scrolls `main`. The node page gives its whole content box to `#browser` and hands the scroll down to the two columns, so the NavTree and the reading pane each carry a scrollbar and neither the window nor `main` carries one.

That is why the citation footer of a node page renders inside `#reading-pane`, last, rather than under the document (`src/hyphae/view/pages/node/markup/page.py`): a footer outside both columns would sit below a fold nobody can reach. It also means a click brings the new node's citations with it, since the swap takes `#reading-pane` out of the response. `test_the_citation_footer_scrolls_with_the_pane_it_cites` pins the containment.

Size a pane against the room its parent gave it — `height: 100%` under a grid row of `minmax(0, 1fr)` — and not against `100vh`, which measures the window and forgets the masthead.

Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-08-27 against `mise run gallery --port 9062` — never 8477, which is a live viewer:

- At 1400×500 on a turn page the document overflowed by 0 px, `#browser` ran from the masthead's lower edge to the bottom of the window, and the pane scrolled 255 px to its end, where the footer came into view
- At 1400×260, small enough that both columns overflow: scrolling the NavTree to its end left the pane and the document at 0, and scrolling the pane afterwards left the NavTree where it stood. The preset control stayed pinned directly under the masthead
- At 800×500 the browser fell back to block flow and `main` took the scroll — 439 px of it, which is the page scroll the ≤900px layout keeps, ending on the footer
- The console stayed empty throughout

# The scroller stays outside the swapped element

The NavTree keeps a reader's place across a click for one reason: `#nav-tree` carries the scrollbar and the swap replaces `#nav-tree-rows` inside it. An untouched scroller keeps its `scrollTop`, so nothing in the markup has to ask for it and `hx-preserve` is not needed.

Move `overflow` down onto the rows and every click drops the reader back at the top of the session. No assertion on served HTML would see it, so the structure is pinned instead by `test_the_nav_tree_keeps_its_place_because_the_scroller_is_not_what_swaps`, which reads the served stylesheet, and by the browser leaf in `tests/e2e/specs/htmx.spec.ts` that clicks a row at a viewport where the tree overflows and reads `scrollTop` across the swap.

Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-08-20 at a viewport where the NavTree overflows. Clicking a row that is scrolled *out* of view does move the NavTree — the browser scrolls the link into view before focusing it, which is the browser being right. A test script that clicks through a driver's "scroll into view if needed" measures that and not the swap; click a visible row by coordinates.

The driver is the trap and not the language: in the TypeScript runner on 2026-08-28, at 1400×220 on a tool page, `locator.click()` on a row 24 px below the tree's foot scrolled `#nav-tree` 43 px before the click landed.

# The open path clamps at the top of the NavTree

A step of the open path above the selection carries `ancestor` on its `<li>`, and the stylesheet stands each depth one row further down than the depth above it, the first under the preset control. One ancestor per depth, so no two steps clamp at the same place. It is pure CSS and a ladder written out per depth, for the reason the indent ladder is: no rule reads `data-depth` as a number, and `app.CSP` forbids the inline `style` a computed offset would arrive as. `test_the_open_path_clamps_at_the_top_while_the_rows_under_it_scroll` reads the class off the served rows and the ladder off the served stylesheet; what a browser does with the two is a browser's to say.

Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-08-28 against `mise run gallery --port 9065` — never 8477, which is a live viewer — in both colour schemes:

- At 1400x170 on a tool call five levels down, where the tree overflows: the session, the bucket, the run, the turn and the api call stood at 67, 87, 106, 125 and 144 px, one row apart under the preset control, while a wheel moved every tool row under them 20 px up and behind them
- They held those places at the end of the scroll, which is the limit the stylesheet accepts: one flat list releases nothing, so a step stays clamped past the end of its own subtree
- Each clamped row painted over the rows passing beneath it, and none reached over the preset control, which carries the `z-index` they are left without
- The console stayed empty

# A row's place on the screen is the script's, not the stylesheet's

`src/hyphae/view/static/nav-tree.js` does the two things a rule cannot: it tops each shown popover at the row it belongs to, and it centres the selected row in the NavTree on load. The popover's left edge stays the stylesheet's — a fixed offset past the tree's width — so a popover never moves sideways, and the script writes `top` alone. Near the foot of the window it clamps, standing the numbers inside the viewport rather than under it.

Place on `mouseover`, `focusin`, `htmx:afterSwap` — htmx fetches the numbers a moment after the pointer lands — and on the tree's own `scroll`, so a popover that is up rides the rows under it.

Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-08-28 against `mise run gallery --port 9064` — never 8477, which is a live viewer — in both colour schemes:

- At 1400x220 on a tool page, where the tree overflows: it opened at `scrollTop` 43 with the selected row's centre 5 px off the tree's own. Hovering a row stood the popover 0.1 px under its top; wheeling the tree 43 px up carried the popover along with the row, to the lowest place the window left it
- At 1400x300 a row at 244 px took a popover standing at 129, its foot 7.7 px off the bottom of the window — the clamp, not the row
- At 1000x560 the ⚒ row that spawned a run carried the attribution line under its counts, and the ◎ rows drew model, context, the three charges and their washes, with `over 2 api calls` where the node was more than one call
- The console stayed empty throughout

# A rendered value goes through one function

Prose a person or a model wrote — a prompt, a run's brief, what a call said — shows as the Markdown it was written in, through `parts.prose`. `src/hyphae/view/text/render.py` owns the escaping.

A title is the other half of that: one line rather than a block, escaped by `src/hyphae/view/text/inline_markdown.py` and rendered by `nodes.Node`'s own cuts, never by a component. Those two modules are the only escaping a page has.

Both mounts of one value use that function: the head a pane previews, and the whole of it the fetch swaps into the same block. A value rendered one way in the preview and another in the fetch is a value a reader cannot tell has a head.

A pane reads as one column of walled values. A payload's `<pre>` carries the rail already; prose carries it through `.detail.quoted`, written from the same `markdown` flag that decided the rendering — so a value cannot render as prose and read as a payload. What tells the two apart is the face they are set in, not whether they are walled: an unwalled block would read as the page's own words rather than as someone else's.

What a tool was passed is marked up as JSON without asking the row — Claude Code records every tool's arguments as an object — and what it returned takes the syntax the record names, else JSON. `highlight.lit` prints a value that parses as neither as the characters the store holds, so the rule costs nothing on a result that is prose.

Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-08-28 against `mise run gallery --port 8492` — never 8477, which is a live viewer — at 1400×900 in both colour schemes:

- On a run page the brief, the prompt and the result each stood behind the quote rail, at the offset the ask block on a tool page stands at, and the enrichment above them carried none
- On a tool page the Arguments came back as indented JSON with keys, strings and punctuation each in their own colour; the Result, which this fixture redacted to a value that parses as neither JSON nor a named syntax, printed whole and unlexed
- The rail is quiet in both schemes — `--line`, the token the ask block already spends — and the accent rail on a Result still reads apart from it
- The console stayed empty

# `Markup` is the only opt-out, and only as a child

htpy escapes every string child and every attribute value, so a component prints text and cannot print markup. Four modules produce a `Markup` — `src/hyphae/view/text/render.py`, `src/hyphae/view/text/highlight.py`, `src/hyphae/view/text/inline_markdown.py`, and `nodes.Node`'s title properties — and a component's only move is to hand one straight in as a child. None constructs one, which `tests/view/test_components.py` reads off the components package's source and `tests/view/test_layout.py` holds over every page's markup too.

An attribute is where the behaviour inverts: a `Markup` handed to one is escaped anyway, so the failure is double-escaped text on the page that no test in this repo would see. These are the text-bearing attributes a component writes, and each takes a plain `str`:

- `title=`, the tooltips and the provenance line
- `data-*` values, which is what every test reads the viewer through
- `aria-*` labels
- the htmx-config `content=` on the frame

The view-model layer already types the split — `Node.tab_title` is a `str` for exactly this reason, while the Markup titles beside it are children-only. A static scan pins today's zero: no attribute in `components/` is handed a name one of the four producers owns. A producer written tomorrow and routed to an attribute is review's to catch, and this paragraph is the notice.

# A space a reader sees is a child you wrote

htpy writes nothing between two elements. Every gap on a page is either the stylesheet's — `gap` inside a flex row, the space around a block — or an explicit `" "` child. There is no third source, and `<span>0</span><span>errors</span>` reads `0errors`.

Nothing committed catches a deleted one: the `data-*` readers see `0errors` and `0 errors` alike, the byte pins bound growth only, and this repo refuses golden HTML on purpose. What makes that acceptable is that the space has no accidental way to die — it is code Ruff never reflows, removed only by an edit a reviewer is looking at, which is the protection every word of page chrome already has. Chromatic's fourteen full-page baselines are the visual backstop; the twenty-five fragment scenarios have none.

# A component's parameters say what they are

Elements are written `htpy.div[...]`, never `from htpy import div`: the prefix is what makes an attribute position something a scan can find, and it leaves `main`, `title`, `code` and `label` free to mean what a component means by them. Several children go in a list — `htpy.div[[first, second]]` — for the checker's sake (`src/hyphae/view/components/__init__.py`).

`tests/view/test_components.py` holds the floor: every parameter keyword-only, and none typed `Any`, `Row`, `Request` or `Response`. That is what a scan can see. Above it is a review obligation — `Kind` where a bare `str` would typecheck, a `NamedTuple` where a tuple would, the narrow union rather than the wide one — because no checker knows which string is a kind.

# A cut value goes through the filter that marks it

A string its query cut arrives one character past the width it is printed at, and the filter that prints it cuts it back and marks where the rest was left behind (`src/hyphae/view/text/format.py:cut`): `line` for a children log's row, `head` and `member` for a header, `short` and `item` for a row of the session list. Print such a value bare and a reader cannot tell a name that ended from one that was stopped. A title arrives marked already, at whichever of the four widths `src/hyphae/view/nodes.py` cut it to.

The query is the other half of that protocol: a value a page prints is cut by the `cut` macro, which stops one character past the width so the filter has something to find (`src/hyphae/analyze/macros.py`). A hand-spelled `substr(value, 1, $width)` stops *at* it and leaves nothing to mark. Every one the library keeps on purpose is named with its reason in `tests/analyze/test_queries.py:HAND_CUTS`, held by set equality, so a new one fails there rather than reaching a page as a value that looks whole.

A closed vocabulary is the one thing cut without a mark: a taxonomy value is bound at its surface's `tag_chars` (`src/hyphae/view/bounds.py`) because a page whose size is arithmetic needs every width named, not because any member reaches it (`src/hyphae/enrich/taxonomy.py`). `parts.counted` takes `mark_cuts=False` for those, and a mark there would claim a name went on when nothing was left behind.

A mark is three bytes on every row of the page that carries it, so adding one to a column of the session list moves `bounds.SESSIONS` — the ceiling is derived from the dearest row, and the pin in `tests/view/test_bounds.py` holds it from both sides against what `tests/view/budgets.py` measured that row at.

# Label every value a test reads

A rendered value goes in a `<span data-field="…">`, and a repeated thing gets a `data-` key naming it (`data-nav-tree`, `data-child`, `data-crumb`, `data-walk`). Tests read the viewer through those attributes, so prose is free to change and the units and marks stay outside the labelled span — a `data-field` carries a value and nothing around it: the value the store holds, or — where the field is a title — the one derivation that composes it. A kind mark is the exception that proves it: it carries no key, and `tests/view/conftest.py:icons` reads it by class.

# What a dev page does when the files change under it

`hp view --dev` puts `src/hyphae/view/static/dev-reload.js` on every page, serves `/dev/reload`, and runs the server under uvicorn's reloader. The stream sends one message per debounced save under the static files (`src/hyphae/view/dev.py`): a stylesheet-only save swaps the sheets in place, and the client script saved beside one reloads the page. A component is Python, so a save there restarts the server instead — the stream drops with the old worker and the client reloads on the reconnect, onto what the new one serves. Nothing else on the page triggers either.

Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-08-29 against `mise run gallery --port 8478` — never 8477, which is a live viewer — on an open turn page:

- Saving `style.css` re-fetched both stylesheets 109ms later, with no document request and no page load: the sheets swap in place
- Touching a component reloaded the page once, 4.4s after the save, at the URL it was on. That is uvicorn stopping the old worker and starting a new one, so a component save is the same restart a reader watches the page follow
- The console carried one error and it was the dropped stream the restart caused, `ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING`: the loop runs under the same `default-src 'self'` as the pages it reloads

The earlier runs of 2026-08-25 and 2026-08-26 were made against Jinja, which re-rendered an edited template on the next request. That bullet is gone with the engine; the second one above is what replaced it.

# The gallery is the scenario list, opened

`mise run gallery` (`tests/gallery/serve.py`) builds a store from the redacted fixtures, serves it under `--dev`, and lists `tests/view/scenarios.py:SCENARIOS` at `/gallery`. One link per entry and no others, so the page a person walks is the list the tier sweeps.

Witnessed in a real Chromium on 2026-08-29 on the gallery's own port 8478 — never 8477, which is a live viewer. The index came up with 39 rows, one per `SCENARIOS` entry, and one link above them that is not a scenario; clicking the turn-node link landed on that node's page with its NavTree and its pane rendered, the reload script on it, and no console error.

A browser check of any page here cannot use Playwright's `wait_for_function`: it evaluates a string as script, and the CSP refuses that. Wait on a selector instead. That is the Python harness's rule and not the header's: on 2026-08-28 the TypeScript runner's `waitForFunction` resolved against the same `default-src 'self'`, in both its function and string forms, with the console empty. `tests/e2e` still waits on selectors, because a selector says what it is waiting for.

Two more traps in that harness. Playwright's sync API delivers page events only while the main thread is inside a Playwright call, so a wait loop built out of `time.sleep` sees nothing and reads as "the page never reloaded" — poll `page.title()` in the loop. And never `git checkout` a file you are editing to strip debug lines from it: the checkout took a whole uncommitted client rewrite with it, and the next hour measured the old file.
