"""Scaffolding for the analysis tier: the fixture corpus as one read-only trace store.

The queries are the subject here, so their evidence has to be rows the real pipeline wrote:
`corpus_db` extracts every recorded fixture transcript into one DuckDB file, once per test
session. Tests read it through `hp query` and never write to it — a test that plants
a row copies the file first, as `worktree_db` does.

    because the CLI reads the zone-aware one and a leaf may read either. A recording keeps the
    dates it was recorded with, and only the reading of it moves.

    Takes `corpus_db` it never reads, so the corpus is built before the first patched test
    rather than by whichever leaf happens to ask for a store first. DuckDB resolves
    `datetime.datetime` once and caches it, so a store built after any converting statement
    has run under this patch cannot bind a real timestamp at all — and which leaf pays that
