"""The dual window and the ISO-week trend, against a frozen store with `$as_of` bound.

Every number a report quotes is quoted in these two windows, so the leaves here check the
arithmetic that relates them: the trailing window is the corpus restricted, and the weeks
partition the corpus. Nothing reads the clock — the smoke tier bans the mechanism, one leaf
proves the replacement decides the window on its own, and the last one puts the tier's
far-future guard on a query left to the default.
