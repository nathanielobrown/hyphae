"""The reading-support queries: the timelines, `view_runs`, `error_records`, `records_slice`.

A timeline is what a reader sees instead of the transcript, so the leaves here are about
agreement and containment: the timeline's cost has to equal the rollup for the scope it
claims, and one run's timeline has to hold that run's rows and no other's. Every expected
number is read back out of the store rather than pinned in the test, so a fixture change
moves both sides together.
