"""The enrichment slice of the library: what is described, what one session says, what to check.

Enrichment writes a model's words beside a run, a turn and a session, and nothing in the
store says whether those words are true. So the leaves here are about the three things a
reader needs before trusting them: a coverage row that counts the items a pass could have
described rather than every row of a level, a per-session sheet that pairs an item's
description with the timeline that shows what the item did, and a draw that puts every
category in front of a validation reader instead of the common ones.

The rows come from `enriched_db`, which plants through the real writer: the keys are a
pass's own, the four model-written fields are invented, and the last item of each level is
left undescribed. That gap can fall outside the project these queries read, so the coverage leaf
plants its own.
