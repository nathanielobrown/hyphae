"""Which sessions and runs an iteration reads, drawn at fixture-sized quotas.

Selection is the one part of the process that decides what nobody will look at, so the
leaves here pin the mechanics a report's realized composition is built from: strata fill in
order, each walks down past what an earlier stratum took, a stratum whose metric runs out
stops short rather than padding, and the slots nobody used fall through to discovery.

Every quota is bound small — the fixture pool is twelve sessions — except the last leaf, which
pins the production defaults a committed report cites.
