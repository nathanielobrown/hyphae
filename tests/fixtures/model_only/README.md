# `model_only/` — a session that ran slash commands and nothing else

Redacted excerpt of `bec99999-cbb7-4d11-9a58-3ad3d0e1c8cf.jsonl`, **Claude Code 2.1.215**, from
`~/.claude/projects/-Users-nob-repos-mycelia/`. Lines 9–11 of 12: the three `user` records that make
the session's one `/model` turn, plus four **borrowed** records below. It extracts to
`turns = 3, agent_runs = 0, api_calls = 0`, which is the shape under test — a session whose turns
drove no model response at all.

45 of the 571 recorded mycelia sessions are in this shape (`hp query sessions`, 2026-08-13),
and enrichment used to describe every one of them from a render with no work in it. The gate in
`src/hyphae/store/enrichment.py` skips them; this recording is what proves it.

Four recordings carry the shape. This one was picked for its date: 2026-07-20 falls inside
`AS_OF_WHOLE`, the one `$as_of` in `tests/analyze/conftest.py` whose 28-day window covers the whole
corpus. A later recording would stretch the corpus past 28 days and leave no `$as_of` able to cover
it, which is what the analyze tier's window constants rest on. `AS_OF_MID` excludes this session, as
it excludes everything recorded after 2026-07-19.

The nine records left behind are bookkeeping and one earlier turn: `mode`, `permission-mode`, two
`file-history-snapshot`, two `bridge-session`, two `system`, and a 1,722-character plain-text `user`
prompt. The first kept record's `parentUuid` still points at that prompt; a trimmed fixture dangles
there by design, and the extractor threads the turn regardless.

## The borrowed records

Lines 4–7 are two more CLI-answered command turns, each with the record that archived what the
command printed. Both were recorded on the same day as the host session and carry the two states a
`/model` turn cannot show: an output that is empty, and an output carried by a `system` record
rather than by a `user` one. Their `sessionId` was rewritten to the host session and each turn's
`parentUuid` rechained onto the record before it; every stdout record still names its own command
turn, which is the link the prompt reads.

| Records | Source session | CC version | Shape it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/clear` turn + its stdout (lines 4–5) | `15289f02-a0fc-41d6-992a-a363e51e8f8c` lines 4–5 | 2.1.215 | the record exists and printed nothing — all 21 recorded `/clear` bodies are empty |
| `/reload-skills` turn + its stdout (lines 6–7) | `cce5af1e-4e2f-4f2c-8b4d-47a85289826a` lines 6–7 | 2.1.215 | the second carrier: `type: system`, `subtype: local_command`, body at `$.content` rather than `$.message.content` (37 recorded instances) |

## Redaction

Every string outside the structural keep-list is `[redacted]`; `gitBranch` is pseudonymised to
`fixture-branch-N`. The tag wrappers survive with their contents redacted, as `spine/`'s slash turns
do — a record's tag is what makes it a command turn rather than a prompt, so flattening it would
change the shape. The command *name* survives for the same reason; its argument does not. `cwd`
stays, since `project_dir` is what puts the session inside the mycelia corpus the analyze tier
filters on.

`data/redact.py` flattens a tag wrapper to `[redacted]`, tag and all, so every wrapper here was
restored by hand after the scrub. The `/clear` body is the one string that survives as recorded,
because it is empty: a body redacted to `[redacted]` is the state the empty one has to be told
apart from.
