"""What the pages show of the model's words, and what they show when there are none.

Enrichment is written by a pass that may never have run against the store a reader points the
viewer at (`docs/enrichment.md`), so absence is the ordinary case rather than the edge: a
store with no enrichment tables, a store whose tables are empty, and a store described but for
the items the pass has not reached yet all have to render. The three leaves below pin those,
and the rest check that what a described store does hold reaches the page — escaped, tagged,
and marked when it was written under a prompt this build has moved past.

The described store is `enriched_db`, whose four model-written fields are invented and say so
(`tests/conftest.py`): no fixture records a model's answer about a private transcript.
