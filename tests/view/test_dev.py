"""The dev loop's server half: what `--dev` adds to a page, and what prod never carries.

Two apps over the one fixture store, compared byte for byte — the seam is served HTML, like
the rest of this tier. Two things HTML cannot show get shapes of their own:

- The reload stream never ends, so `TestClient` cannot read it. It runs a whole request
  through its portal and buffers the body before handing back a response
  (`starlette/testclient.py:353`), so a response with no last chunk hangs the caller rather
  than streaming to it. The leaves below drive the ASGI protocol instead: the same app, the
  same middleware, a different client
- uvicorn's graceful exit is only observable in a real uvicorn, so one slow leaf runs one and
  interrupts it with a stream open

The change sets handed to `event_for` are invented — watchfiles yields `set[tuple[Change, str]]`
and no recording of one exists — which is why one slow leaf drives the real `awatch` and checks
that shape against what the invented ones assume.
