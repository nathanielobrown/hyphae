"""Reading a rendered NavTree, and building the level the store says one should hold.

`data-nav-tree` carries a row's node key — `kind:id`, the key its URL is built from — so a NavTree
reads back as a list in document order, and `data-more` marks a row standing for children the
cap left out. The levels here are built out of the store the way the design orders one, in the
test's own SQL: turns with compactions dropped in by time, then the thread's unattributed
bucket, then — under the session alone — the runs nothing placed. A run hangs under the tool
call that spawned it, in every preset. Reading the order back out of the store rather than
pinning it means a re-recorded fixture moves the expectation instead of reddening the tier.

`cell` is the design's kind x preset table written out — every cell in full, including the ones
a preset passes through, so a table edit has to be an edit here before it can pass. A plain
module rather than the conftest, so the readers of a tree and the levels they are checked
against sit in one place.
