    """An expansion is bounded by the same cap its node's own page is, and by nothing else.

    An api call's expansion lists the tools it called, so a call that called two hundred is
    where the bound has to hold: the fragment reads one page of the level at the reader's
    `?log=`, and the way past that page is the link to the call's own page rather than more
    rows. Planted, because the densest call the corpus recorded made four tool calls — and
    planted at every cap, with `&` in each string a row prints, so what this weighs is the
    fragment at its ceiling rather than at the fixture's sizes.

    The body above those rows is weighed over all three kinds a log can open, not just the
    call's: a turn's is the dearest of them, because a turn's body is the one that carries
    what an enrichment pass wrote. So the described store, planted at the enrichment's caps
