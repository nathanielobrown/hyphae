"""The app around the node browser: what every response owes a reader, whatever it serves.

A page cites the query behind it, names each id in its URL by the word in front of it, asks for
no asset the viewer does not ship, and is painted by a stylesheet that knows only fields a page
carries. The store it reads is opened read-only. Every expectation is derived from the store
the app is serving rather than written down, so a fixture added to the corpus does not silently
stop being covered.

The session list is `test_app__list.py` and its filter form `test_app__filters.py`; the header
above a node is `test_app__headers.py`, and what a page does with untrusted text is
`test_app__safety.py`. The node pages themselves live in `test_node.py` and the NavTree beside
them in `test_nav_tree.py`, each with its neighbours.
