`src/hyphae/view/` is organized by page and then by kind (`plans/view-layout/design.md`): one
package per page, the same file names inside each, and a shared layer under them all. The
layout is the contract — it is what makes "the context for one page is one directory" true —
and nothing but this file holds it. Each leaf reads the checkout the way
`tests/view/test_components.py` reads the components package's rules: `ast` over the source,
plus a fresh-interpreter probe where an in-process answer is already spoiled.

Every scan carries a companion assertion. A rule that finds nothing passes, and a tree that
moved out from under it is exactly how it comes to find nothing.
