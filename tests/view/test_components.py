"""The contracts the components package holds that no rendered page can show.

The viewer's markup is typed Python (`src/hyphae/view/components/`), so promises Jinja's
environment used to make structurally have to be made here instead: a component imports no web
framework, its signature is something a checker can hold, and it never writes markup where htpy
will escape it. Each leaf reads the source a reviewer reads, or drives htpy itself — what a page
finally serves is the rest of this tier's business.

The two source scans each carry a companion assertion. A scan that finds nothing passes, and a
name that moved is exactly how it comes to find nothing, so every "no component does X" leaf is
paired with a "the thing X names is still there" one.

The last two leaves are about the one thing pyrefly is not allowed to check here. htpy's child
parameter is a recursive type alias, which pyrefly cannot decide, so `bad-index` is off over this
package alone — and a canary holds that narrowing to its reason.
