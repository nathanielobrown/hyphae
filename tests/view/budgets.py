# What a page may weigh. The list is the page a corpus grows, so `bounds.SESSIONS.ceiling` rows of
# what one row can hold have to fit under it. Raised from 350,000 when the pages began showing
# what an enrichment pass said: a described run row costs half again what a bare one does, and
# `bounds.CHIP_BUDGET` multiplies that 200 times. The alternative was cutting the budget, which
# would put the widest forest the corpus records behind a "+N more" nobody can open.
PAGE_BYTES = 500_000
# What a node page may weigh, which is its own budget rather than the one above. The NavTree is
# `DEPTH` levels of `KIN` children, so the window a level opens on prices about half of the
# page — and it is a window, not a limit: a tail row fetches what it left out and stands the
# rows in its own place, without a page boundary anywhere. Widening the window is a reader
# reaching further per click, and pinning it here rather than against `PAGE_BYTES` keeps that
# choice off the list pages, whose ceilings are derived against the number above. The
# arithmetic under it — `worst_node_bytes`, at every ceiling at once — is kept true by the
# leaf at the bottom of this file, and the total is in the last line below. Raised from 1,050,000
# when the children log's rows began saying what each child was asked: a row went from 1,654 B
# to 6,079 B, and 100 of them is 442,500 B more page. That is what a reader gets for it — a
# level of a hundred read without opening one, where before it was a hundred bare numbers.
# Raised again from 1,450,000 when a pane began showing a value in its own syntax: a preview
# marked up is budgeted at `MARKED_CHAR_BYTES` rather than at an escape, and a `Bash` call
# previews a third value besides. The two together are 120,600 B, all of it on one preview of
# one pane — and what a reader gets is the shell and the file read as what they are.
#
# Raised from 1,570,000 when the NavTree's window went from 50 children to 200 and its titles
# from 48 characters to 110: four times the rows at a quarter more each is 3.3 MB of tree, and
# the NavTree was already four fifths of the page. That is the whole of the increase, and what a
# reader gets for it is a level of two hundred read where a level of fifty was — the fetch a
# tail row offers is the same rows over a second request, so the bytes were already reachable;
# what moved is how many clicks reach them.
#
# Raised again from 4,900,000 for the mark every row now carries saying what kind of node it
# is, in the pattern the children log's column heads already use.
# `<span class="icon" aria-hidden="true">❖</span> ` is 45 B of markup around a 3-byte mark,
# plus the space after it: 49 B a row, and 3,217 rows of it is 157,633 B, with 800 B more on
# the crumbs and 73 B on the pane's heading and the browser tab. The old ceiling left 34,666 B,
# 10 B a row, so the raise landed before the markup rather than a template edit becoming an
# argument about a ceiling. What a reader gets for it is a tree read by shape rather than by
# title.
#
# Raised again from 5,050,000 for the prompt a pane now reads as the markdown it was written
# in. A rendered preview is budgeted at `MARKED_CHAR_BYTES` like a highlighted one, so the
# pane's dear previews went from one to two: 4,000 characters at 25 B more each is 100,000 B,
# all of it on one preview of one pane. What a reader gets is the turn's ask read as prose —
# headings, lists and fenced code — where the whole-value fetch already rendered it and the
# head beside it printed the source.
#
# Raised again from 5,150,000 for the two columns an api call's row now fills: what the call
# said, and the tools it went on to call. They make a call's the dearest row in any children
# log — `MEASURED_LOG_ROW_MARKUP` went from 1,450 B to 1,650 B — and a log is a hundred rows,
# so 20,000 B of page. What a reader gets is a turn's calls read without opening one, where
# before the column that named them said the same model a hundred times. The arithmetic under
# it comes to 5,143,767 B, and `NAV_TREE_ROW_BYTES` is pinned from below so the 26,233 B left over
# cannot be spent by a row that quietly grew instead.
#
# Raised again from 5,170,000 for the two values a run's pane now reads off the call that
# spawned it: what the run was asked, and what it sent back. Both are markdown, so a run's is
# the first pane whose three previews are all rendered — `DEAR_PANE_DETAILS` went from two to
# three, which is 4,000 characters at 25 B more, 100,000 B, on one preview of one pane. What a
# reader gets is a run read whole where the page used to show only the line it was named by.
# The arithmetic comes to 5,243,767 B, and the slack under the ceiling is the same 26,233 B.
#
# Raised again from 5,270,000 for the context bar every row of the NavTree now draws: a fill class
# and a tip class, eight bytes a row at their widest spelling, which over 3,217 rows is
# 25,736 B — the whole of what the ceiling had spare and a thousand more. What a reader gets is
# how full the model's window was at every node of the walk, read down the NavTree rather than a
# node at a time. The arithmetic comes to 5,271,003 B, and the 28,997 B over it is what the
# next thing a row grows by is measured against.
#
# Raised again from 5,300,000 for the popover every row of the NavTree now fetches: the trigger is
# 362 B a row — its own URL, the trigger's two events, and the five attributes of the swap it
# cannot inherit — which over 3,217 rows is 1,164,554 B, forty times the slack the ceiling had.
# It is the dearest thing the NavTree has ever grown, and the row it is measured on is the one
# where the URL is longest. What a reader gets is the numbers behind the bar and the badge on
# every row without leaving the node they are reading: what a phase held in the window, what it
# added, and where its dollars went. The arithmetic comes to 6,435,557 B, and the 29,443 B over
# it is what the next thing a row grows by is measured against.
#
# Raised again from 6,465,000 when the templates went under djLint (`docs/ui-development.md`).
# The formatter writes each attribute of a tag on its own line and indents every block it
# opens, and Jinja renders that whitespace into the page: a NavTree row went from 1,681 B to
# 1,866 B, which over 3,217 rows is 595,145 B, and a log row, the chrome and the crumbs
# together add 18,000 B more. It is the second dearest thing the NavTree has ever grown, and a
# reader gets nothing at all for it — what the repo gets is one formatter over the templates
# and an editor whose output `check` agrees with. The arithmetic comes to 7,047,702 B, and the
# 32,298 B over it is what the next thing a row grows by is measured against.
#
# The row then grew 4 B when its key attribute became `data-nav-tree`, which over 3,217 rows
# is 12,868 B.
#
# Raised again from 7,080,000 for the dual cost badge: a row with agent runs under it draws two
# numbers rather than one, and the wash moved off the row onto the value it washes, so each half
# carries a step class of its own. The dearest row draws both, which is 55 B, and over 3,217 rows
# 176,935 B. What a reader gets is what a turn drove beside what it spent, without opening it.
# The arithmetic comes to 7,233,105 B, and the 26,895 B over it is what the next thing a row
# grows by is measured against.
#
# The row then grew 4 B for the context bar's third band class, which stands a turn's own growth
# apart from the context it opened on (`view/nodes.py`): 12,868 B over 3,217 rows, spent out of
# that slack rather than by raising the ceiling. The arithmetic then came to 7,245,973 B, with
# 14,027 B left.
#
# Cut to 6,500,000 when the pages became htpy components. htpy writes nothing between two
# elements, so the whitespace a formatted template put on every row of the page went with the
# templates: a NavTree row fell from 1,929 B to 1,703 B, which over 3,217 rows is 727,042 B, and
# the chrome, the crumbs, the log rows and the previews give back 34,635 B more. The arithmetic
# comes to 6,483,912 B, once the crumb's own markup is re-measured rather than carried, and the
# 16,088 B over it is what the next thing a row grows by is measured against.

# under rather than a second cap under that. The arithmetic is `worst_expansion_bytes`: the

# a page of a hundred and a page of one: the dearest thread costs 765 B a row. It is the

MEASURED_RECORD_BYTES = 800

# What the markup around one row of the pane's children log costs, with the strings it carries

# performs, the numbers that tell two children apart, and the row around them. Re-measured
# through the app by the leaf at the bottom of this file, every cap full of `&` and every knob
# at its longest — 6,112 B on an api call's row, of which 4,515 B is content at those caps and
# 150 B the knobs, leaving 1,447 B. A string at its cap is 300 escapes and the mark that says
# it was cut; the arithmetic below charges the 301 escapes the cut selected, which is 2 B a
# string more than a row can really carry. The dearest row moved from a tool call's to an api
# call's when a call's row began saying what the call said and which tools it called: nine
# columns against a tool row's seven, and the same three strings.
MEASURED_LOG_ROW_MARKUP = 1_500
# How many strings one row of a children log prints, each cut to the log's width and selected a
# character past it. Three is the widest row there is: an api call's row is the model that
# answered, the head of what it said, and the tools it went on to call; a tool row is the
# tool's name, the head of what it was asked, and the command that head describes. A turn row
# prints one and a run two. Listed rather than counted off
# `view/pages/node/columns.py:COLUMNS`, because most of those columns are a number or a stamp;
# what keeps the number honest is the leaf at the bottom of this file, which plants every
# string a row can print past its cut and weighs the row.
LOG_ROW_STRINGS = 3
# What the control under a children log costs, with both of its links rendered: the nav around

# the bottom of this file, on logs driven to one row a page and read at a middle page, which is
# the only page carrying both links — 565 B, the widest of the 30 that sweep renders, 20 of them
# with both links. Driving the log to one row a page is also what writes `log=1` into the suffix
# on both of those URLs, where `worst_knob_bytes()` prices two digits: the widest pager there
# can be is 2 B over this, which the node ceiling above absorbs many thousand times.
MEASURED_PAGER_BYTES = 565
# And what the markup around one crumb of the chain down to the selection costs: the link, the
# node's key, the mark saying what kind of node the step is, and the glyph saying who named it.
# Measured the same way — 556 B less 200 B of title at `CRUMB_CHARS` and 50 B of knobs, leaving
# 306 B. It read 330 until here, which was never a measurement: the comment beside it said 306
# too, and subtracted a title of 550 B that `CRUMB_CHARS` stopped cutting long before this
# branch. So a crumb is the one row whose re-pin is not the engine's doing — what it lost is
# arithmetic nobody had re-run, and it is held from both sides under `HYPHAE_PIN_EXACT` now.
MEASURED_CRUMB_MARKUP = 306
# And what the markup around one previewed value costs — the heading, the `<pre>` and the line

MEASURED_DETAIL_MARKUP = 550
# How many fat values one pane previews at once. Three is the most any kind shows: a `Bash`

# below has not priced.
PANE_DETAILS = 3
# And how many of those the page marks up rather than printing as the characters the store
# holds. Three, which is a run's pane: the brief it was named by, the prompt it was given and
# the answer it sent back, all written by a person or a model. A turn previews the prompt and
# what followed its slash command, an api call what it said and what it thought. A tool's pane
# asks for a syntax on all three — the command as shell, the arguments as JSON, and the result
# as the file's syntax where the record names one and JSON where it does not — but a value that
# parses as none of them prints as the characters the store holds, so what a tool's pane spends
# is a question about the call rather than about the kind.
DEAR_PANE_DETAILS = 3
# What a node page carries outside its NavTree rows, its log rows and its previews: the crumbs
# down to the selection, the node's own facts, and what a pass said about it. The session is
# the widest of the eight panes — every string in its header is one a transcript wrote, and its
# two lists grow with the session — so the allowance is a session header's, cut in SQL.
# The preset control rides here too, three links carrying the node's own URL, the children
# log's own table head — a word and an icon for each column of the shape the log lists — and,
# on a pane reading a failed tool call, the step to the failure before it and the one after.
# The pane's own heading and the browser tab each carry the mark saying what kind of node the
# page is about, which is the whole of what the two of them cost here.
# What a pass wrote sits here too, and each of its two lines carries the fetch that offers the
# rest of it — a URL written twice, the way every other value a pane previews offers its own.
# The two steps above the chain sit here too, for the reason the crumbs do not: they are once a
# page rather than once a level. The project step is the dear one — it prints a project path
# and links to the session list narrowed by the whole of it, so the path is paid for twice,
# once escaped and once URL-encoded.
# Re-measured through the app by `test_bounds__node.py` at 18,100 B, which is what it is pinned
# at: `HYPHAE_PIN_EXACT=1` is what re-pins it. Up to five of its strings

# `<span class="` of 13, a class of 3, a `">` of 2, a `</span>` of 7, and the character itself
# escaped to 5. A construction bound like the one above rather than a measurement, for the same
# reason — what a lexer makes a token of is a property of the lexer, and a value every character
# of which is its own token costs the lot.
#
# The class is three characters because `view/text/highlight.py:_ShortClasses` holds it there. Left
# alone the formatter joins a name for every step up to a token type Pygments has a name for
# (`l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain`, 25 characters), and those types are reachable — the markdown
# lexer hands a fenced block to whatever lexer the fence names. `test_highlight.py:
# test_every_class_the_markup_carries_is_one_of_pygments_short_names` is the pin.
#
# The dearest content the viewer marks up today reaches 26 bytes a character (`&;` repeated,
# read as `.sql` or `.py`) without any lexer being adversarial. A preview rendered as the
# markdown it was written in is priced at the same number and reaches it the same way: a fenced
