"""Starting, serving, and the three things that go wrong under a running viewer.

The store is a file another process writes. An extract can take its lock while a page is
open, and can replace its schema between two page loads, so both are checked per request
rather than once at startup — and both answer with a page that says what to do. How long one
request holds that lock is here too: the window is a lifecycle fact and no page shows it.

The third is the viewer's own: a component that raises halfway down a page. It is why
`Viewer.html` renders whole before the response exists rather than streaming.
