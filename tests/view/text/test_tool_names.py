# What the store hands a formatter, per tool: the fields `store/macros.py:tool_fields`
# extracts, with everything the tool did not carry NULL. Written out as one table because
# fourteen small rules are where a registry drifts from the design that specified it
# (`plans/viewer-polish/design.md`, the formatter table).
#
# Every value here but four is lifted from a recorded session: `Read`, `Bash`, `Agent`,
# `SendMessage` and `ToolSearch` from the fixtures (`tests/fixtures/spine`,
# `tests/fixtures/parallel_tools`), the rest from this project's own sessions in the canonical
# store, which is where the field names came from too. `Grep`, `Glob` and `TodoWrite` have no
# row anywhere in that store, so those three cases are **invented** and the fields they read
# are the ones those tools document rather than ones a recording proved. The fourth is the
# `PushNotification` message: what the session recorded is an agent's prose about private work,
# replaced in the fixture by an invented sentence of the same shape
# (`tests/fixtures/spine/README.md`), and this row reads the replacement.
