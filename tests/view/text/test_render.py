"""What a transcript's own text is allowed to do once it reaches a page: nothing.

Every input here is invented markup, and it has to be — redaction flattens every string in
the fixture corpus, so no recorded session can carry a payload. These are the inner of the
two escaping layers the design names; the outer one is the planted-sentinel route test in
`tests/view/test_app.py`, which sees what a template does after `render.py` is done.

Two renderers are pinned here, because they answer the same escaping questions: `render.py`,
which turns a fat value into a block of prose, and `inline_markdown.py`, which turns one line
into a title. The second one reaches further — a NavTree row, a crumb, the browser tab — so
every pin below is taken twice.
