"""The landing page: one row per project the store holds sessions for.

The expectations are derived from the store the app is serving rather than listed here — the
fold is re-run through `sessions.project_predicate`, the same shape the query file and the
CLI's `--project` use, so a page that folded some other way reds even though both sides move
together. Two things the fixture corpus cannot show are planted and labelled: no recorded
session ran in a worktree, and every recorded timestamp recedes from the wall clock, so the
trailing windows would go quietly empty as the corpus ages.
