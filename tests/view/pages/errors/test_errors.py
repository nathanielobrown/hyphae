"""Getting to a failure: the mark on a NavTree row, the session's list, and the stepper.

A session can fail a tool call five spawns down a run tree, and neither the NavTree — which opens
one path — nor the walk gets a reader there without reading everything in front of it. These
leaves cover the three surfaces that do: the `error` mark a NavTree row carries, the session-wide
list at `/session/{session_id}/errors`, and the prev/next pair a pane offers when the node it
is reading is itself a failure.

The fixture corpus records two failed tool calls, one apiece in two different sessions, which
is enough for the mark and for the list but not for an order or a step. A session that failed
several is planted onto recorded rows: `is_error` is a flag the store already holds — both
recorded failures prove the shape — so flipping it on a real tool call is what a busier
session looks like, not an invented one.
