"""Reading a session in order: the prev/next controls beside the pane.

Neither control descends. A click on a NavTree row is how a reader goes down, so these two go
along the level the reader is standing on — the next row, then the next — and at the end of it
out to whatever follows the thing that level sits in. Prev is the same level backwards, and
from its first row the node that holds it. A step that changes level is marked, because a
reader who did not ask to leave the branch should see it coming.

These leaves follow the controls themselves rather than calling `walk.py`: what a reader gets
is the chain of pages, and only fetching them proves the chain closes. The expectation is read
off the NavTree each page was served with — the rows at the selection's own depth are its level,
in the order the NavTree drew it — so the reading order is checked against what the reader sees
rather than derived from the store a second time.
