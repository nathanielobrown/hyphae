"""The popover behind a compaction's NavTree row: the window it dropped, and what asked for it.

A compaction is the one node of a session made of no api calls at all, so there is no spend
here and no model — what the boundary record holds is the two token counts either side of the
drop (`docs/schema.md`). The ⊟ row draws the span between them as a bar read backwards, and
this popover is that span in figures.

The expectations come out of `live_compactions` in the test's own SQL, so the popover has
nothing to agree with but the store. Every other kind's popover is `test_numbers.py`.
