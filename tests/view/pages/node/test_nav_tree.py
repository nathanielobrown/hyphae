"""The NavTree beside a node page: one open path through the session, and nothing else open.

The NavTree is served with the pane in one response, so these leaves fetch the same node URLs
`tests/view/test_node.py` does and read the rows instead, through the readers in
`tests/view/nav_trees.py`. What they hold to is where a node hangs: which level a page opens, which
turn a compaction lands under, where a run stands, and what a cap cuts when a level runs past
what the page prices.

What a row draws is `test_nav_tree__rows.py` and `test_nav_tree__meters.py`; what `?nav=` leaves
standing is `test_nav_tree__presets.py`.
