"""The node page: one node of a session served whole, with the pane beside its tree.

Every node has a URL that renders cold as a full page, and a tree click is an `hx-get` of that
same URL — so the leaves here fetch node URLs both ways and read the pane through `data-*`.
The pane is three parts: the node's own facts, the one or two fat values it previews with the
way to the whole of each, and a page of its children as links. The first part is this file; the
previews are `test_node__details.py` and the children log is `test_node__logs.py`.

Which node each leaf reads is picked out of the store by `tests/view/selections.py`.
