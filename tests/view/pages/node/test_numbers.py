"""The popover behind a NavTree row: the exact numbers its bar and its badge stand for.

A row draws two summaries and can print neither — a bar is twenty steps of a window, and a
badge is a dollar figure at cent precision. The popover is the numbers themselves, fetched
when a reader points at a row or tabs to it (`docs/viewer.md`).

The expectations are built out of `live_api_calls` in the test's own SQL rather than out of
the columns the page reads, so a derivation that drifted between the bar and the popover has
nothing to agree with. The spend is priced one call at a time, which is the reading the page
cannot take: it groups a node's tokens by model and prices each group once, and that is the
same arithmetic only if the group's cache write splits the way every call in it did.

The dollars that cross a thread boundary — what the agent runs under a node spent, and the
total the two come to — are `test_numbers__spend.py`, which reads back through the helpers
below.
