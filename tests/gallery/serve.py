"""The gallery: every scenario the viewer tier pins, as a page you can open and edit against.

`mise run gallery` builds a store from the redacted fixtures, serves it under `--dev`
(`view/dev.py`), and adds an index at `INDEX` listing `tests/view/scenarios.py:SCENARIOS`. Editing
a component or a stylesheet reaches whatever is open — a stylesheet through the reload stream, a
component through a restart — so the loop is: pick a scenario, save, watch. The clock is the
corpus's own and never the wall's (`corpus_now`), so a page holds still between two launches.

Test tooling, not a package feature — it imports `tests/` freely. Privacy is structural: a port
is the only thing that reaches it from outside, so the process can serve nothing but the corpus
it builds itself.
