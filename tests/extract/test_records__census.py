"""Every record in the canonical store, read through the model its type resolves to.

The fixtures are redacted excerpts of a few sessions; this is the whole archive. It is what
answers the question the fixtures cannot: does a Claude Code version nobody trimmed a fixture
from write a field the models do not declare? Each one it finds becomes a declaration with a
citation before the readers move onto the models.

Off by default. `HYPHAE_LIVE_STORE` names the store, and the store is private session data, so
`mise run check` never runs this and CI cannot. Run it by hand:

    HYPHAE_LIVE_STORE=<the path `hp query --help` prints> \
        uv run pytest tests/extract/test_records__census.py -s

Nothing here asserts on a record. A `raw_records` row is transcript content and a failing
assertion prints its operands, so every assertion below is on a count or on a field path.
