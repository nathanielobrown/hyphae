"""Subagent transcripts: the work a session delegated, parsed like the work it did itself.

A subagent writes its own file under the session's `subagents/`, in the same record shapes
the main transcript uses. Every row it produces carries the agent's id as its `source`, so
one session's rows stay separable by who did the work, and an `AgentRun` beside them says
who asked for the work.
