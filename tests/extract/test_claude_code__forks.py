"""Forks: agents that continue a conversation someone else started.

Claude Code writes a fork two ways. A **copied-history** fork replays its parent's records
into its own file, verbatim uuids and all, then carries on; a **by-reference** fork copies
nothing and opens mid-conversation, naming the context it inherited. Both wreck a count
that assumes a uuid belongs to one transcript, so the extractor decides who owns a record
and flags every later copy as `replayed`.
