"""What the record models claim: Claude Code's shapes, and a recording behind every claim.

The world here is the fixtures — recorded, redacted sessions — because a model that describes a
transcript format can only be checked against a transcript. Nothing in this tier invents a
record: the models say what Claude Code writes, so an invented record would let the models
describe a format nobody has ever seen.

Two leaves read live source instead: `records/registry.py` names every shape the parser has
seen, `records/` describes those shapes, and nothing makes the two agree at runtime.
