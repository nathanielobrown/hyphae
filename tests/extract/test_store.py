"""Reading the trace store back as traces: the round trip, and the source filter.

The OTLP export ships the store rather than the transcripts on disk, so `StoreSource` is the
extractor that pipeline runs on (`plans/otlp-export/design.md`). Everything the exporter can
send is only as true as this rebuild — a column silently dropped here ships a corpus missing
a field nobody notices — so the round trip compares whole objects rather than fields.
