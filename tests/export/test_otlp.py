"""Span shaping: what a recorded session becomes, and the ids that make a re-send a re-send.

No store and no HTTP here — recorded traces in, spans out. Delivery is
`test_otlp__delivery.py`; this tier is the only one that can drive a session the source
filter excludes. The per-entity arms — tool calls, runs, compactions, PR events — are
`test_otlp__shaping.py`; this file holds identity and the whole-trace invariants.
