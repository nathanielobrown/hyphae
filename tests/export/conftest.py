"""An OTLP/HTTP endpoint in this process, and the store the export tiers ship from.

The design's chosen seam: real httpx, real protobuf, a real store, and a server that decodes
what arrived instead of a mock that records what was asked. It can be scripted to answer the
way a backend under load does — a partial rejection, a 429, a 500 — which is the only way to
test the failure paths the prior importer's data loss came from.
