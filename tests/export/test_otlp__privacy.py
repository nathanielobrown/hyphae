"""What may not leave the machine, and what must.

Publishing a transcript to a third party is irreversible, so this tier sweeps the raw request
bytes rather than the parsed attributes: a stray field, a `logfire.msg` built from a prompt,
or an attribute added next month is caught without anyone remembering to update a list.

Redaction flattened every recorded string to `[redacted]` or a `fixture-*` pseudonym, so no
leaf here can assert on real transcript text. Sentinels are planted onto real rows instead.
