"""Scaffolding for the enrichment tier: a store built from recorded fixtures, and no `claude`.

The enrichment renders read rows, so their evidence is a real DuckDB built by running the
existing pipeline over `tests/fixtures/` — the same keys the pipeline really writes. Building
it costs an extraction per fixture, so `fixture_db` builds once per test session and
`mutable_db` hands out a copy to any test that plants or deletes rows.
