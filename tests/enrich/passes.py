"""What a test drives an enrichment pass with, and how it reads back what the pass wrote.

`FakeClient` records what it was asked and answers from a script, so every claim about rounds,
staleness and failure handling is checked against real rows without a request leaving the
machine. Its answers are invented, as model output must be — there is no recorded session to
draw them from. The readers below turn the store back into the keys and stamps a leaf asserts
on. A plain module rather than the conftest, so both enricher test files see one fake.
