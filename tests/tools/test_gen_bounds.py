"""What the four bounds tables have to hold: the viewer's own numbers, and all of them.

The bounds prose is the viewer's payload contract, so a table that drifts from `bounds.py` or
from the page arithmetic is worse than no table at all. Every leaf here reads the live modules
— none of them spells a number, and the coverage leaf makes a new bound impossible to leave
undocumented by accident.
