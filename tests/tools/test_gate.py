"""What `tools/gate.py` promises the reader of a green run, and the reader of a red one.

Every gate in `check` and `check-fast` runs through the wrapper, so two of its guarantees hold
the whole quality suite up: a passing command collapses to one line, and a failing one replays
everything it captured *and* exits with the command's own code. A wrapper that flattened that
code would turn every red gate green and nothing else in the repo would notice.

The wrapper is driven here the way mise drives it — a subprocess with `MISE_TASK_NAME` in its
environment — rather than by calling `main()`, because the exit code and the single stream
write are the contract, and neither is observable in-process. The leaves at the foot read
`mise.toml` instead: they are what keeps a new gate from leaking raw tool chatter back in.
