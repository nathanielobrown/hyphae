"""Where a credential is allowed to appear in what GitHub runs, and what guards it there.

`check.yml` opens by promising a gate that needs no secret, store, or network, and every leaf in
the suite is written to hold it to that. The browser tier breaks both halves — Chromatic is a
third party and the archives go over the wire — so it is a second workflow, and this is the file
that keeps the split honest: one workflow with the token, a fork's pull request kept away from
it, and the git history Chromatic needs to find a baseline.

The repo is public, so a fork's pull request is untrusted input that runs here. GitHub withholds
secrets from one, which makes the guard below a clear failure rather than a leak — but a job
that reaches for a token it will not get fails after the sweep, which is worse than not asking.
