"""Scaffolding for the tooling tier: read a generated markdown table, or `mise.toml`, as data.

Every leaf over a generator asserts a property of generated text against the live code it was
generated from, so the one thing that tier shares is the parser that turns a table back into
cells. No test compares a generator's output to a golden string: a golden would pin today's
wording and say nothing about whether the numbers in it are still the code's. Beside it, the
one reader of `mise.toml`, which two files ask different questions of, and the one reader of
the import contracts, which two files hold the code and the diagram to.
