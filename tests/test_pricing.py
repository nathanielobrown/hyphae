"""What a recorded reply cost, from our own price table.

The table is ours, not Claude Code's — a model it lacks is a gap in our list, not a schema
change, so the tests below pin behaviour on both sides of that line. What they cannot pin
is whether the numbers match Anthropic's published prices: no seam reaches that, and a test
asserting a constant against itself proves nothing. `pricing.py` records the check date.
