-- The exact numbers behind one tool call's NavTree row: how much it gave back, and what else the
-- api call that made it asked for in the same breath.
--
-- A tool call reports no usage of its own — its tokens are its api call's (`docs/schema.md`) —
-- so there is no window and no price to print. What the store does hold is the size of the
-- result, which is the honest proxy for what the call put in front of the model, and the other
-- calls it was made alongside. What comes back per sibling is the fields it is named by
-- (`analyze/macros.py:tool_fields`); the words are composed in Python
-- (`view/builders.py:tool_titles`), so the siblings read the way the same calls read everywhere
-- else.
