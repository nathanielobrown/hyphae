-- The tool calls under one api call, in outline: the NavTree level below a call.
-- `$api_call_id` NULL asks the other question the NavTree has: every tool call under one turn,
-- ordered by the call that made it and then by its own index. That is the `noapi` preset's
-- level, where the api calls are hidden and their tool calls hoist to the turn — and, at
-- `$turn_id` NULL, the same for the calls that answer no turn. Unattributed is decided by the
-- join, not by `c.turn_id IS NULL`: a fork replays its parent's turn (`view_nav_tree_calls`).
-- Thin like `view_nav_tree_turns` and `view_nav_tree_calls`, and unlimited for the same reason — the
-- cap lives in the composition (`view/pages/node/nav_tree.py`), where it has to keep the row the open path
-- goes through. A tool call costs nothing of its own: what an api call spent is the api call's.
-- The one exception is a row that asked for an agent run, which is charged what the call
-- holding it cost — so this query alone returns that price, and every other surface builds a
-- costless tool node (`view/builders.py:tool_node`).
