-- What a thread pays to rebuild a context it already had. A mid-thread api call that writes
-- its whole prompt to the cache and reads nothing back is the thread starting over: the
-- prefix cache missed, and every token of the conversation is billed at the write price
-- again. Iteration 2's A11 saw this where a coordinator sent a follow-up into an open agent
-- run — the run had gone idle long enough for the cache to expire — and had no way to count
-- it (`reports/2026_08_09_mycelia_agent_friction.md`).
-- A reload is a call that is not its thread's first, writes at least `$min_rebuilt_tokens`,
-- and writes at least `$min_rebuilt_pct` of the context it sent. The share is the detector:
-- a growing thread writes the turn's new tokens and reads the rest, so 90% written is a
-- thread that kept almost nothing. The token floor only keeps trivia out — moving it from
-- 10,000 to 20,000 changes the corpus count by 7 events in 935, while moving the share from
-- 90% to 80% adds 312 (measured on mycelia, `as_of=2026-08-09`). Both are bound because
-- neither is a fact about Claude Code: they are where we cut a continuum.
-- The count is slightly generous and slightly short, in ways worth knowing before quoting it:
-- the share's denominator counts only cached tokens, so a call that sent a lot of uncached
-- input still reads as fully rebuilt (27 corpus reloads send more than 10% uncached); and
-- `corpus_api_calls` drops replayed rows, so 21 resumed threads open on a call that is not
-- their true first and lose the cold rebuild a resume always pays (at most 2%).
-- Two columns bound the readings a reload is *not* evidence for:
--   `idle_reloads` — the reload followed a gap of `$idle_seconds` or more, which is A11's
--     shape. Read it as an upper bound on cache expiry, not a certainty. The gap runs
--     start-to-start, because `started_at` is when the request went out (the timestamp of the
--     record it answers) and request-to-request is the interval a cache entry ages over; but
--     it also spans the previous call's own generation, and measuring end-to-start instead
--     moves the corpus figure 627 → 576. Separately, 102 corpus idle reloads follow a call
--     that wrote 1-hour cache entries, and 21 of those came back inside the hour, so a live
--     entry was there to hit. The rest missed with the thread still working, for a reason the
--     transcript does not record
--   `compaction_reloads` — a compaction boundary landed between the previous call and this
--     one, so this is the call that reloads the window from the summary and rebuilds by
--     design. Compaction is `agent_compactions.sql`'s subject, not this one. The flag is
--     anchored on the call *after* the boundary because that is the one that pays: 1,014 of
--     1,116 boundary timestamps equal the following call's `started_at`. Flagging the call at
--     or after the boundary instead marks the summarizing call, which reads its context back
--     rather than rebuilding it, and leaves the rebuild unexplained — that anchoring found 24
--     of 928 corpus reloads where this one finds 40 (19 of 648 in the window)
-- Neither column filters, so a reading that needs only A11's shape can subtract them itself.
-- Three grains in one result, told apart by `grain`: the corpus total, one row per
-- `agent_type`, and one row per affected thread — the row a report cites when it names a run.
-- `reload_cost_usd` has two honest denominators and they differ by a factor of two: name
-- whichever you quote. `thread_cost_usd` is what the threads that reloaded cost in full ($607
-- of $5,886, 10.3%, in the 2026-08-09 window); the window's total spend across every session
-- is a different, larger number this query does not carry (`session_shapes.sql`; $11,110 for
-- the same window, making the same $607 5.5%).
