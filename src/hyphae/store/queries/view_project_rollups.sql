-- Every project the store holds sessions for, one row: what the viewer's landing page ranks.
-- Reads `corpus_rollups`, so a resume's copied api calls count once for the project rather
-- than once per session file — a project's spend is what the corpus spent, not the sum of
-- what its session files each claim.
-- Worktrees fold onto the checkout they were cut from: a worktree sits under its repository,
-- so every stored directory counts under the shortest stored directory it sits in. The `/` in
-- the match is what keeps a neighbouring checkout whose path merely begins with this one's
-- out of it (`sessions.project_predicate`, which the CLI's `--project` filters by).
-- Both trailing windows are computed from `$as_of`, which the caller binds and no clock here
-- reads: a page citing SQL's own clock would cite a line that answers something else tomorrow.
-- A path is shown cut to `$head_chars` and offered as a filter whole or not at all — a link
-- carrying a path cut to its head lands on a list holding nothing.
