-- What an enrichment pass said about one session, about one of its threads' turns, and about
-- its agent runs — the rows the viewer shows beside what each item actually did.
-- `enrichment_digest` is the same question for a report: it reads the `enriched_*` views, so
-- an undescribed item keeps a row with a NULL description and coverage reads honestly. This
-- one reads the enrichment tables directly, because a page shows an undescribed item as an
-- item with nothing beside it — a row of NULLs would be markup standing in for absence.
-- `$source` is the thread whose turns the page renders: `main` on a session page, the run's
-- id on a run page. The other two levels belong to the session however it is being read.
-- `$head_chars` cuts the model's own name at a width of its own: a model string is longer
-- than a taxonomy word and shorter than a sentence.
-- A store no pass has touched holds none of these tables, which is why the viewer asks the
-- catalog before it runs this (`view/enrichment.py`).
