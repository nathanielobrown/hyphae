-- Which described items a validation read spot-checks: a seeded draw over one level,
-- `$per_category` items from each category. Stratifying by category is what puts a rare
-- member of the vocabulary in front of a reader — a flat draw over thousands of runs returns
-- the common ones, and the categories nobody checks are the ones a classifier gets wrong.
-- The pool is every session `--project` selects rather than the trailing window: a pass
-- describes the whole store, and validating it reads the same set. `--since` narrows it.
-- Each row carries what it takes to open the item — the session and source `run_timeline`,
-- `session_timeline` and `enrichment_digest` are bound at — and what it costs to read it.
-- The seed is bound, so the draw is one anyone can re-run and a later read can rotate.
-- `$level` has no default: the three are different populations — 2,500 runs, 1,400 turns and
-- 470 sessions on the mycelia corpus — and a draw over "some level" answers nobody.
