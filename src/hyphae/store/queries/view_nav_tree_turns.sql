-- The rows of one level of the NavTree beside a node page, so a row is deliberately thinner
-- than `session_timeline`'s: one title head at `$nav_chars` + 1 — the cut protocol
-- `view/text/format.py:cut` reads — one cost, and how much of that
-- cost our price table could not price. `$source` is the thread — `main` for a session's
-- own, a run's id for a run's — which is what makes one query serve every level that holds
-- turns. Unlimited on purpose: the NavTree caps a level in the composition (`view/pages/node/nav_tree.py`),
-- where the cap has to keep the row the open path goes through whatever else it cuts.
