-- Which command produced the error, when the error text does not say. `tool_failures` counts
-- per tool and `error_signatures` per error text, and neither reaches a bare `Exit code 1` —
-- a shell's exit code names nothing, so a grep that found no match and a build that broke are
-- one group. This groups the same failures by the shape of the command line instead.
-- `command_head` is the command word plus the bare lowercase words after it, so `gh pr checks`
-- and `gh pr create` stay apart while `grep -rn "…" src/` and `grep -c … README.md` come
-- together. What sits before the command is cut first: leading `VAR=value` assignments, any
-- number of `cd <dir> &&` wrappers — 839 of the 1,487 failed Bash commands in mycelia's
-- 2026-08-07 window open with one — and a directory path on the command word itself.
-- Nothing else survives into the group key: no flag, path, quoted argument or URL can reach
-- the output, which is what makes a table of private command lines publishable.
-- A row whose `signature` is NULL is that shape's calls that *succeeded* — the denominator an
-- error count is read against, since a command that fails 100 times in 110 calls is a
-- different claim from one that fails 100 times in 4,000. `$min_occurrences` can drop it.
-- Bind `$mentions` to keep only command lines containing a phrase: the head is the *first*
-- command, so a `grep` further down a pipeline is invisible to the grouping and countable
-- only this way.
