"""What a route asks FastAPI for instead of closing over it: the viewer, a connection, knobs.

Every route is a module-level function, so what used to arrive by closure arrives by
`Depends`. `ViewerDep` is the app's one `Viewer`, put on `app.state` by `build_app`; `Db` is
one request's read-only connection, opened and closed around the route.

`Db` holds that connection until the response is built, which is longer than an explicit
`with open_store(...)` inside the route. Short windows are what let `hp extract` write while a
page is open, so `Db` is for the fragment routes, whose markup is a line or two. A document is
read by a dependency of its own, which opens the store and closes it before any markup runs
(`view/pages/`).

`checked` is here rather than beside the sizes it reads because refusing what is out of bounds
is a route's job: a presenter is callable without a request, and a module that imports
`HTTPException` is not (`tests/view/test_layout.py`). The node page's four knobs are parsed the
same way, one page in (`view/pages/node/routes/knobs.py`).
