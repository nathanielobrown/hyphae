"""What the model said about the items on one page, or nothing at all.

Enrichment rows are written by a pass that may never have run (`docs/enrichment.md`), and the
tables themselves are created by that pass rather than by the exporter — so a store the viewer
opens read-only may not hold them. `described()` asks the catalog first and hands back an empty
answer when they are absent, which is what makes a page over an un-enriched store render the
same as a page over an item the pass has not reached yet: nothing beside the item.
