"""Where a session failed: the list of every failed tool call, and the step between two.

The NavTree opens one path and the walk reads the session in order, so neither gets a reader to
the third failure of a run five spawns down without reading everything in front of it. This
module is the way that does not: one list of every `is_error` tool call the session holds,
whichever thread it ran on, in the order they happened — and, where the pane is already
standing on one of them, the failure read before it and the one after.

Session-wide for the reason the unattached bucket is: what a subagent failed at is what the
session failed at. The list is capped like the landing page (`view/bounds.py`) rather than
paged, and the stepper walks that same capped list — a failure past the cap is one neither
surface reaches, rather than one the stepper offers and the list denies.

`view/pages/node/walk.py` is the neighbouring concern, and reads the same way: what is beside
the pane, answered from the store rather than from the rows the page happens to have drawn.
