"""What a page calls each field it prints.

A header is a column of the store read by a person, so the two names it carries answer to
different readers: the `data-field` beside every value stays the store's own column, and the
word above it is what someone says out loud. Closed on purpose — a header field with no entry
here raises rather than falling back to the column name, and `tests/view/test_app__headers.py`
checks the registry against the facts the components and the panes actually ask for.
