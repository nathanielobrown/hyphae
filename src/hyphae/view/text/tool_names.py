"""How a tool call is named, wherever the viewer names one.

A tool call's title is read from the input field that tells two of that tool's calls apart —
a path for a file tool, the command for `Bash` — under a glyph that stands for the tool, so a
NavTree row says which tool ran without spending the width on its name. The store extracts the
fields (`store/macros.py:tool_fields`) and this module composes the name out of them: SQL
ships fields, and the name a reader reads is Python's.

`name_tool` is the entry point and `view/builders.py` its only caller, so the surfaces that
print a tool call — its own page, a NavTree row, a crumb, a children log, the errors list, and
the api call above it — read one derivation. A tool absent from `FORMATTERS` is not a gap: it
takes the shape rule below, which names a tool nobody here has heard of.
