"""The viewer itself: what `build_app` assembles over a trace store, and what `serve` runs.

`build_app(db_path)` returns a FastAPI app over one store. It mounts the statics, answers a
locked or moved store with a page rather than a stack trace, puts the `Viewer` on `app.state`
for the dependencies in `view/deps.py`, and extends one page package's routes onto the app in
turn — the two lists, the node page, then the four pages that are not a node's.

Nothing the viewer serves writes: every request opens its own read-only connection
(`view/store.py`), checks the store's schema version, renders, and closes. That is what lets an
extract run while a page is open, and what makes a locked store a 503 rather than a crash.

Route order is a contract: `tools/gen_routes.py` reads `app.routes` in registration order into
the table in `docs/viewer.md`, which is why the routes are extended onto the app rather than
included as routers — an included router arrives as one opaque object that no consumer of
`app.routes` can see through.
