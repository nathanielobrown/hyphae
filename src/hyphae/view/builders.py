"""How one store row becomes what a surface prints: the node, its facts, and its log row.

Every surface that names a node — a NavTree row, a crumb, a children log row, a pane — calls
one of these, so the title, the URL and the share a reader sees are the same wherever they
read it. `view/nodes.py` holds the vocabulary they build in.

A row in, a node out, and nothing about the page the node lands on. What a row is *shown* as —
the facts a body prints, the cells of a log row — is the page's own (`view/pages/node/reads.py`).
