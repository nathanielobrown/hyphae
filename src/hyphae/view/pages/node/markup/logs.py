"""The pane's children log: one numbered page of what is under a node, a row per child.

A table, because the row is a handful of numbers and a reader who cannot tell an api-call count
from a tool-call count from a time of day is reading nothing. The columns are the shape's own
and come from `view/columns.py:COLUMNS` — the head below writes them and every row fills all of
them, so a cell is always under its own heading. The words above them are the registry's, the
same one a pane's facts read.

A row is a line that gets a reader to the child's own page rather than a preview of it: what it
prints in the wide column is the child's title, the same words the NavTree row and the pane
heading use (`docs/viewer.md`).

The four row types below are what a route hands in instead of a store row: the shape decides
the columns, and the type of the row decides the cells, so a query that stopped returning a
column is a type error rather than a blank cell under a heading.
