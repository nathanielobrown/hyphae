"""The popover behind a NavTree row: what the badge and the bar on it stand for.

Three shapes, because three kinds of node are measured three ways. A node made of api calls
has a window and a price; a tool call has neither — its tokens are its api call's — and reports
the size of what it gave back; a compaction has no calls at all and reports the window it
dropped. Each arrives as one element htmx swaps under the row that asked (`docs/viewer.md`).

Every shape a component here takes is declared here, filled a layer up: what the popover
prints of the window, and the priced lines under it (`view/pages/node/numbers.py`).
