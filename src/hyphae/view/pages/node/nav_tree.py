"""The NavTree beside a node page: the path down to the selection, and only that path opened.

Every node of a session has a URL of its own, and the NavTree is how a reader walks between
them. What renders is one open path — the selection's ancestors, the selection, and the
selection's children — so a session's whole shape is never on the page at once. The rows come
back flat, in document order, because a click swaps the list out of band and a nested list
would swap only the part of itself the click happened to land in.

The path is resolved bottom-up in refs, which are ids and nothing else, and then expanded
top-down: a node renders out of its parent's level, so every visible node has a visible parent
by construction rather than by a check afterwards.

Reads the store one level at a time and says which query it ran, so the page can cite it.
Everything else here is arithmetic over the rows those queries returned.

    runs is keyed by ids — so a caller holding a ref can read a level without rendering the
    node it hangs under. Which is what a tail row's own fetch does (`view/app.py`).

    `descends` is the key of the child the open path goes through, or None where this level is
    not on it. A preset filters children and never the expanded chain: where the cell hides
    that child, the level comes back in full instead, so a reader standing on a kind the preset
    hides still sees where it sits. Adding the step to the filtered level would draw part of

    A run under a cut child goes under with it, the one place "a run is always visible" stops:
    `spread` runs on the rows a page rendered, and the tail row's `+N` counts the level's own
