"""A URL for every node of a session: the session, a turn, a run, a call, a tool, and the rest.

Each route reads only what its own kind needs and hands the rest to `browse`, which is the page
they all serve. The two buckets are here as well — a thread's api calls that answer no turn,
and the session's runs no tool call spawned — because a bucket gets a page like anything else
(`CONTEXT.md`).
