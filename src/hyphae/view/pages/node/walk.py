"""Prev and next beside the pane: how a reader gets along a level and back out of it.

Neither control ever descends. Going down is what the NavTree is for — a click on a row opens
it — so the two controls read the level the reader is standing on: the next sibling, then the
next, and at the end of the level whatever follows the thing it sits inside. Prev is the same
level backwards, and from its first row the node that holds it. A step that leaves the level
says so, because a control that changed depth without warning would move the reader somewhere
they did not ask to be.

What the walk reads is the store, never the rendered rows. A `?kin=` cap cuts what is drawn
beside the pane; it cannot cut what comes next, because a reading order that shortened with
the NavTree would silently skip nodes. Each step is one level read — an ancestor's children —
on top of the chain the page already resolved.
