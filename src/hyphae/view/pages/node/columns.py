"""What a children log heads and fills: one table of columns per shape of log.

A pane lists one kind of child at a time, and each kind is read by different columns — what
tells two turns apart is not what tells two tool calls apart. This module is that table, plus
which shape of log lists each kind of node and how wide that log is.

A column head marked with the same thing a node's own kind is marked with reads it off
`view/nodes.py:GLYPHS` rather than spelling it again: the `⇄` over a turn's api-call count and
the `⇄` on an api call's NavTree row are one reader meeting one thing twice.
