"""What a URL may ask a node page for, and what a page hands back in every link it mints.

Four knobs: the view, and the three sizes (`docs/viewer-bounds.md`). Every node route takes
them as one `Knobs`, built by the one dependency `routes/knobs.py` declares — which is where a
value outside its bounds becomes a 400. A checked `Knobs` mints its own `suffix`, which every
link on the page carries, so a reader who narrowed the NavTree keeps it as they walk. The paging
controls live here too: a page number is the one knob a children log adds to that suffix.
