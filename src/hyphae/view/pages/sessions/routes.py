"""The session list at `/sessions`: what a request may ask of it, and the page that answers.

Which sort and filter keys the list offers, what a query-string value has to parse as, and the
page those choices compose. The SQL is `view/store.py`'s, beside every other page's
composition. This module hands it a key out of a closed dictionary and a value already parsed,
which is what makes a key outside them a 400 here rather than a fragment of SQL there.
