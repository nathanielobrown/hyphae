"""Everything one enrichment level is, declared once per level.

A level is a prompt, a set of rows, and a reader that finds them. `LEVELS` holds all three
together, so adding one is one entry here beside the renderer it names — rather than an edit
to a version map, a subject map, a budget constant, a render dispatch, a table map, a reader
map and a round order, none of which would complain about being forgotten.

The entries are written in round order: bottom-up, because every prompt embeds its children's
descriptions rather than their text.
