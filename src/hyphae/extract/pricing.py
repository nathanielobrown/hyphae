"""What an API call cost, from the one price table we maintain.

`MODELS` is what every reader asks: the extract prices a recorded reply through
`compute_cost`, the viewer draws its context bar against the window, the analyze macros read
the window, and `hp enrich` quotes a pass off the same rates (`hyphae.enrich.cost`).

This table is **ours**, not Claude Code's. A model missing from it is a gap in our list, not
a schema change to surface, so `compute_cost` returns `None` and the caller records the
model name with no cost — a queryable absence that can be filled in later. Crashing here
would kill a backfill the day a new model ships. A quote has no backfill to protect, so it
crashes instead.

Prices are USD per million tokens, read from
<https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing> on **2026-08-30**, the date the whole
table was last checked against that page — a row added from another source may carry its own
later dated comment. Nothing in the test suite can check them against that page; re-read it and
update this date when you check the table as a whole.

Two published modifiers are deliberately absent, because no recorded call uses them: fast
mode and US-only inference. Across the mycelia corpus's ~290,000 assistant records (scanned
2026-08-07), `usage.speed` is `"standard"` on half and absent on the rest, never `"fast"`,
and `usage.inference_geo` is `"not_available"` wherever it appears, never `"us"`. A call
carrying either would price low, so add the multiplier when one shows up.
