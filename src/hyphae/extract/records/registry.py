"""The closed world of a Claude Code transcript: every record type, subtype, block and tag.

These registries are what makes the reader closed-world. Claude Code owns these shapes and
changes them without notice, so a kind not registered here stops a test run and is archived and
tallied in an extract (`records/unknown.py`): a type we quietly skip today is a wrong count
months from now. A block or a tag outside its registry raises wherever it runs, because a reader
is already reading it.

Names only. The field-by-field models that describe what each shape holds, and the recording
that proves each claim, are the modules beside this one; `docs/schema.md` prints them.
