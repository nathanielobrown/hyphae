"""The trace store as an extractor: its rows back out as `SessionTrace`s.

Pairs with an exporter that ships somewhere else — the OTLP export reads the store rather
than the transcripts on disk, because the store is the archive (a pruned session exists only
here), because a backend then mirrors exactly what the analyses and the viewer cite, and
because reading rows costs a fraction of re-parsing every record.

Rebuilding is mechanical: `export/duckdb.py`'s `TABLES` registry drives the read, so the
columns, the session key and the row order are the ones the write used and a new column
reaches both sides at once. Provenance is not rebuilt — `extract_state`'s `extractor` and
`extractor_version` come back verbatim, naming the parser that produced the rows rather than
this reader.
