"""The Claude Code extractor: which sessions a project has, and what each one holds.

Assembly. It finds a project's sessions, sorts each one's files (`extract/layout.py`),
reads each transcript into lines (`extract/transcript.py`) and those lines into entities
(`extract/parse.py`), and stamps the result with a fingerprint that decides re-extraction.

The reader below it is closed-world on purpose: every record type, every `system` subtype and
every tag a prompt can lead with is registered in `extract/records/registry.py`, and anything else
stops the run. What each field means, and the session that proves it, is in `docs/schema.md`.
