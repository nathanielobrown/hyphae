"""What one transcript holds: the file read into lines, and what each line says on its own.

One thread at a time — the session's own transcript or a subagent's — and no knowledge of
which files make up a session (`extract/layout.py`) or of how a refresh is driven
(`extract/claude_code.py`). `read_lines` parses a file into lines and validates each against
its record model, `resolve_duplicates` collapses a uuid the file wrote twice, and the readers
below answer what the file says about the session as a whole: where it ran, what it was
called, the pull requests it touched. Turning those lines into turns, api calls, tool calls
and compactions is `extract/parse.py`.

Every field these readers reach for is declared on a model in `extract/records/` with the
session that proved it (`docs/schema.md`).
