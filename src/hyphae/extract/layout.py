"""Claude Code's layout on disk: where a project's sessions are, and what files hold one.

Claude Code writes one JSON-lines transcript per session, under a directory named for the
session's working directory:

    <projects_root>/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl
    <projects_root>/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl

This module finds those files and sorts them by what reads them. It parses none of them —
records belong to `extract/transcript.py`, and the two rot on different schedules: the layout
is stable (`docs/session-layout.md`), the record shapes are not (`docs/schema.md`). The one file
it reads whole is an offloaded tool result, which is text rather than records.

The layout is closed-world like the record registry: a file whose place we cannot name raises
`SessionLayoutError` (`extract/errors.py`) rather than being skipped.

What a project *is* to the layers that query the store is `hyphae/projects.py`.
