"""Which lines of a session's transcripts are copies of another's.

A fork opens on the conversation it inherited, records and uuids alike, so one uuid can name
lines in several files of one session. This module decides which file owns each record; every
later copy is a replay, kept in the store and left out of any count (`docs/store.md`).

Ordering the transcripts is the whole problem, and `_transcript_order` says how it is settled.
