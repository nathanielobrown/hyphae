"""The version the whole store file carries, and the two guards that hold a file to it.

Three modules create tables in the one DuckDB file — `export/duckdb.py`, `enrich/store.py`,
and `export/otlp_delivery.py` — so the version stamps the file rather than any one owner's
tables, and lives here instead of with one of them. This module imports nothing from
`hyphae`: the owners import it, and one of them already imports another.

Both guards run before an owner's DDL touches a file. `migrate` carries a store forward to
`SCHEMA_VERSION` by the steps in `MIGRATIONS`. `check_shape` refuses a store whose tables no
longer match the DDL that declares them, which is what a rename with no migration behind it
leaves: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` skips the table that exists, `SELECT *` views rebind
across the rename, and the mismatch surfaces at the first insert as a binder error naming a
column, with no version and no remedy in it.
