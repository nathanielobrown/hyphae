"""Getting shaped spans to a backend and knowing what landed.

At-least-once with stable ids. A delivery row in the store records the fingerprint and the
mapper version a session shipped under, so re-running ships only what moved and a shaping
change re-ships the corpus (`docs/otlp-export.md`). A failed run re-sends the session whole
rather than diffing what got through — an append-only backend never dedupes.

What a session becomes on the way here is `export/otlp.py`; this module reads no session
row, only the spans that module made and the delivery ledger it owns.
