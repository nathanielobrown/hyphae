"""The local trace store: one DuckDB file, one table per model entity.

The DB is the archive, not a cache. Claude Code prunes transcripts from disk after a few
weeks, so a session stays here after its files are gone.

Writing is per-session replace inside one transaction — delete every row this session owns,
then insert the new ones. That makes re-extraction idempotent whatever changed, and it is
why a table added in a later slice must be added to the `TABLES` registry too: a table left
out of the delete would keep stale rows forever.

Count through the rollup views rather than the base tables. The tables hold what each file
recorded, replays and resume copies included. `session_rollups` drops the replays, so a
record a fork copied counts under the transcript that ran it first. `corpus_rollups` drops
resume copies too, so a session totals only the work no earlier session already holds — use
it to sum across sessions, and `session_rollups` to ask what one session's files say.
