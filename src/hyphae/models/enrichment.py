"""The enrichment vocabulary: what gets described, and the closed words it is described in.

`Level` names the three things that get an enrichment row. `Category` and `Outcome` are the
taxonomy every level is written in — closed and code-resident on purpose: `GROUP BY category`
only means something over a fixed set, and the code that validates a model's answer is the
code a reviewer reads. A member added here is a taxonomy change — bump `TAXONOMY_VERSION`
with it, which makes every existing row stale without invalidating it, so the viewer can
render version-N rows while version-N+1 backfills.

Here rather than in `enrich` because the viewer reads these words too, and `view` imports
nothing from `enrich`.
