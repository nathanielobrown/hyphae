"""What enrichment describes: the rows each item is built from, keyed by its `Level`.

An item is one thing that gets one enrichment row. The store reads these out of the trace
store (`enrich/store.py`), the renders turn them into prompt text (`enrich/prompts.py`), and
the enricher carries them between the two. Nothing here renders or queries, and nothing here
imports outside `models` — so the store can select a row into its type without importing the
pass that describes it. The render's size limits are the render's own (`enrich/prompts.py:Budgets`).
