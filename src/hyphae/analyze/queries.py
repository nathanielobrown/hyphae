"""The query library: one `.sql` file per question, and the vocabulary its manifest is written in.

A finding cites the query behind it, so a question lives in a versioned file a report can
name and anyone can re-run — not in a Python string. Two consumers share this library: the
`hp query` runner and the trace viewer (`plans/trace-viewer/design.md`).

What is here is how a query is declared and every width one binds: the parameter types, the
shared `Param`s, and the character and row counts that bound what a page can ask for. What
each query takes is `analyze/manifest.py`, and the SQL itself is `analyze/queries/`.
