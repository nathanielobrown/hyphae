"""The SQL functions the query library is written against, and the one call that installs them.

A query file is the unit a report cites and a reader re-runs, so a rule two files share cannot
live in either of them: the copies drift, and then one query denies what the other reported.
What lives here is the shared half — a definition several queries call by name — as a DuckDB
temp macro, created on whatever connection is about to run a query.

Both consumers install the same set: `analyze/runner.py` before the query `hp query`
was asked for, and `view/store.py` on the connection a page reads through. That is the trade a
shared definition costs: a query file naming one of these runs under a consumer that installed
them, and under a bare `duckdb` shell it does not.
