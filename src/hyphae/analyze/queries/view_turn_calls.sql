-- One page of the api calls under one turn: the children log under a turn's node page.
-- A turn is not a bounded unit — the largest in the canonical store aggregates megabytes
-- across hundreds of tool calls — so the page is the unit and `$page_calls` is its size.
-- Ordered by "index", which is unique and ascending within a (session, source): `$skipped`
-- is how many calls the pages before this one held, and 0 asks for the first page.
-- `$turn_id` NULL selects this thread's unattributed calls, which is the bucket's own page.
-- Unattributed is decided by the join and not by `c.turn_id IS NULL`, for the reason
-- `view_nav_tree_calls` states: a call naming a turn recorded on another thread is this thread's.
-- `$log_chars` is the width the two model names a call row shows are cut to.
-- `text` is previewed here and fetched whole one value at a time (`view_call_text`); the
-- tool rows under a call are their own query (`view_call_tools`), capped the same way.
--
-- A row names the tool calls it made as well as counting them: what comes back is the fields
-- each of them is named by (`analyze/macros.py:tool_fields`) and the words are composed in
-- Python (`view/builders.py:tool_titles`), the same derivation the tools log's own rows read,
-- so a call's row and the log inside it name one tool the same way. Every tool comes back and
-- the composed line is cut whole where it is printed: what a reader gets is the first tools of
-- a call that made forty, marked where the column ran out, rather than forty stubs.
