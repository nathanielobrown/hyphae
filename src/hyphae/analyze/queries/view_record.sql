-- One whole raw transcript record, by the line number a citation names. The untruncated `raw`
-- is the point: this is the route from a preview to the text the session actually held, and
-- the bound is one record rather than a page of them.
-- `$line_no` is a key like the session and the thread beside it: "some record of this thread"
-- is not a question anyone asked, and the answer would be private transcript either way.
