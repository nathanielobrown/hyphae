-- How much of the corpus enrichment has described, and what it said about it. One row per
-- period, level, category, outcome and stamp; `level_items` is the level's whole population,
-- so `share_pct` reads straight off the row.
-- A NULL category is the level's undescribed items — its coverage gap — and a stamp column
-- moving is the other health signal: rows written by two models, or under two prompt
-- versions, are a pass someone stopped halfway.
-- The denominators are the items a pass would describe, which is not every row of a level:
-- enrichment describes main turns, every agent run, and the sessions that drove a model
-- response (`src/hyphae/enrich/store.py`). Counting the rest would report a permanent
-- shortfall.
-- Counts through the `corpus_*` family like everything else here, rather than the
-- `enriched_*` views, which are LEFT joins over `live_*`: a resume's copied turn is enriched
-- under the copy's own key, so dropping the copy drops its enrichment row with it.
-- Reads tables an enrichment pass writes (`docs/enrichment.md`). A store no pass has touched
-- does not hold them, and this query fails on it saying so.
