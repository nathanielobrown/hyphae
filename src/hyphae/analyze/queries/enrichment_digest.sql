-- One session's enrichment sheet: what the model said about the session, each of its main
-- turns, and each of its agent runs. Read it beside the timeline that shows what the item
-- actually did — `session_timeline` keys on the same `turn_index` and `turn_id`, `run_timeline`
-- and `view_runs` on the same run id — which is how a description gets checked against the
-- records it was written from.
-- An item no pass has reached keeps its row with a NULL description, so what is missing is
-- visible rather than absent. Bind `$level` to `turn`, `agent_run` or `session` to read one
-- level; NULL is all three.
-- Reads the `enriched_*` views (`docs/enrichment.md`), so it is the `live_*` family a keyed
-- query always reads: a resumed session shows the rows its own files hold. A store no
-- enrichment pass has touched does not hold these tables, and this query fails on it saying so.
