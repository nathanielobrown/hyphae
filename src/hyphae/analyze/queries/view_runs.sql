-- One session's agent runs, each against the turn its spawning call sits under.
-- `spawn_turn_id` NULL means the join failed, which is the whole definition of an unattached
-- run: the page lists it in its own section whatever the cause — no `tool_use_id`, a
-- spawning call naming a tool call the store lacks, or the exclusion below.
-- `tc.source <> a.id` is load-bearing. A fork's own transcript holds an un-replayed copy of
-- the call that spawned it, so without the exclusion the join matches that copy and the fork
-- chips onto a turn of its own timeline — listing itself as its own child.
-- `store/enrichment.py:item_parents` applies the same rule for the same reason.
-- The three display columns are cut to `$chip_chars`, one character past it: a run is a chip
-- on someone else's page, and a page's size is arithmetic over its rows rather than an
-- observation about the corpus. The extra character is what tells a value that ended from one
-- that was stopped — whoever binds the width cuts again at it and marks what it cut.
