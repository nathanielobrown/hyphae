-- Every session in the store, one row: what the viewer's list ranks and drills from.
-- Reads `session_rollups`, so each row says what that session's own files hold — the numbers
-- a reader opening the session will see, resume copies included.
-- The viewer wraps this SELECT to sort and filter it (`view/store.py`): the file stays the
-- citable core, and no user-supplied value is ever interpolated into it.
-- `$item_chars` bounds how much of each agent definition's name a row's list carries, and is
-- cut in the file rather than around it because nothing filters on that name: the rest of a
-- row's cuts are composed where the filters are, since those read whole values.
