-- Every failed tool call of one session, whichever thread it ran on, in the order they
-- happened: the list behind the viewer's errors page and the stepper beside a pane reading a
-- failure (`view/failures.py`).
-- Session-wide rather than per thread, for the reason the unattached bucket is: what a
-- subagent failed at is what the session failed at, and the NavTree opens one path — so nothing
-- else on a node page reaches a failure five spawns down without reading everything first.
-- No join up to the api call or the turn: each row leads to the tool call's own page, which
-- carries the crumb chain that places it. Thin like `view_nav_tree_tools`, and cut to the same
-- width, because both name a node rather than describe one.
-- The order is total — `(source, "index")` and `(source, id)` are each unique within a
-- session (`store/trace_store.py`) — which is what a cut means anything against: a page showing
-- the first `$errors` of a partial order would show different rows on two reads of one store.
