-- The exact numbers behind one node's NavTree row: where it left the model's context window, and
-- where its dollars went. What the row draws as a bar and a badge, written out (`docs/viewer.md`).
--
-- `$kind` names which api calls the node *is* — the one rule that differs between a session,
-- an agent run, a turn and a call. Written once here rather than as a query apiece, because
-- four files answering one question are four chances for a popover to deny the row it opened
-- from. A tool call has no api calls of its own and is not a kind here; `view_numbers_tool.sql`
-- answers for one.
--
-- `$source` is the thread the node's window stands on: `main` for a session, whose reader is
-- reading the main thread; the run's own id for a run; the node's own thread otherwise. It is
-- also what picks the calls out, for every kind alike — a session included. What the threads it
-- spawned cost is `subtree_usd` below, which the popover prints as its own line rather than
-- summing into the three a turn spends on its own calls (`view/pages/node/numbers.py`).
--
-- Synthetic replies are out of the window numbers for the reason `view_nav_tree_turns` states —
-- Claude Code's own placeholders report no tokens at all (`docs/schema.md`) — and in the
-- spend, where our table prices them at nothing.
