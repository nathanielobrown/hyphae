"""The canonical trace model: what one recorded agent session looks like, whatever wrote it.

A `SessionTrace` is flat lists keyed by natural ids — a mirror of the relational schema an
exporter writes, not a nested tree. Ids come from the data (a message id, a record uuid), so
they survive re-extraction and enrichment rows keyed on them survive with them. None of them
is globally unique: a resume copies its ancestor's records verbatim into a new session file,
so every row is scoped by `session_id` and by `source` — the transcript inside the session
that recorded it.

Slices 1 to 4 of `plans/trace-pipeline/design.md` cover sessions, turns, API calls, tool
calls, agent runs, compactions, PR links, cost, and the archive — every line of every file
the session wrote, plus the tool outputs it moved out of the transcript.
