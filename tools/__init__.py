"""The repo's own tooling: what the code already owns written back out, and what runs the gates.

Each `gen_*` module exposes `generate()` and a `main()`. Most print what an `aigarden:cog`
block splices into the document that carries it — a table, the Layout tree, the package graph;
`gen_e2e_routes` writes a file another runtime loads instead. `gate.py` generates nothing — it
wraps one `mise.toml` gate and reports whether it passed. Repo tooling rather than shipped code:
nothing under `src/hyphae/` imports any of it.
