"""The route table in `docs/viewer.md`: every page the viewer serves, from the app's own routes.

Run by a cog block in that document — `uv run python -m tools.gen_routes` — so a page added to
`view/app.py` reaches the table without anyone remembering it. A row names the page, gives its
URL, and describes it in the handler's own docstring cut to its first sentence, which makes the
docstring the one place a page is described: a handler that carries none crashes this rather
than printing a blank cell. The name is the other half — vocabulary rather than prose, so it
comes from `PAGE_NAMES` below and not from whatever a docstring happens to open with.

Fragment routes are left out by rule rather than by a list, because they serve pieces of a page
a reader never types a URL for (`nodes.BODY_URL`, `nodes.KIN_URL`).
