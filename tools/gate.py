"""Run one gate command and say only whether it passed.

Every task in `check` and `check-fast` routes through here (`mise.toml` says which, and why).
mise drops its own per-task headers and footers through `task.output` and `task.quiet`; this
wrapper owns the rest. It runs the command with both streams captured, and

  - on success prints one line, `✅ <name>  <elapsed>`, swallowing whatever the tool says when
    nothing is wrong — "245 files already formatted", pytest's dots, pyrefly's INFO lines;
  - on failure replays everything it captured, verbatim, then prints `❌ <name>  <elapsed>` and
    exits with the command's own code.

So the noise a run costs is the noise of the gates that failed, and a failure is easy to find
rather than buried. One place holds that contract, instead of a per-tool quiet flag in each
task — half these tools have none, and the ones that do would go quiet on failure too.

`GATE_VERBOSE=1` — that spelling and no other — replays a *passing* command's output as well,
before the mark. That is the audit: the wrapper only ever swallows an exit-0 command, so a
warning reaches the green path only if the tool warns while still passing, and this is how you
go looking for one.

Ctrl-C hands back what the tool had printed, marks the gate `interrupted` and exits 130. The
partial output is why a reader interrupts a silent gate, so losing it would be the wrong answer.

The name comes from `$MISE_TASK_NAME`, so a task needs no argument for it:
`run = "tools/gate.py uv run ruff format --check ."`. Outside mise it falls back to the
command's own basename.

Stdlib only, and run by its shebang: under mise `python3` is the project's own virtualenv
interpreter, so the shebang buys no independence from it — what it buys is one exec instead of
`uv run`'s lockfile resolve per gate, and importing nothing means a broken dependency tree is
something this can still report on rather than die of.
