"""The Layout tree in `CLAUDE.md`: what lives where, glossed by the thing that lives there.

Run by a cog block in that file — `uv run python -m tools.gen_layout` — and it writes the fence
as well as the tree, because a cog marker inside a fenced block is an example rather than a live
block. The entry list below is curated: the tree is an index a reader walks, so what it shows
and in what order is an editorial choice. What each entry *says* is not — a package's gloss is
its own docstring and a document's is its opening sentence, so the tree cannot drift from the
thing it describes without that thing drifting first.

Three directories carry words written here instead: they hold no prose about themselves, and
what a reader needs to know about them is a convention rather than a summary.
